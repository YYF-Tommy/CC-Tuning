''The first thing Ole needs to do is build the squad and I don't think bringing in a £100m player is going to help the players there,'' said the former England captain, 33. Speaking to the BBC, he added, ''Ole would buy players worth between £30m-40m with potential and then build his squad from five or six players. You can bring in players like Messi, and Juventus striker Ronaldo, Ramos and Bale but it will cost you £350m and after two years that money is gone. Barcelona forward Lionel Messi and Juventus forward Ronaldo have won 10 Ballon d'Ors while Real Madrid captain Ramos, 33, has won the World Cup, the European Championship and four Champions League titles. Ramos' teammate Bale, 29, has won the European title four times and has long been linked with a move to Old Trafford. Rooney expects it to be a difficult time for Solskjaer, who has been linked with a number of transfers, including Ajax defender Matthijs de Ligt. Solskjaer, who succeeded Jose Mourinho as United manager, has begun to build his squad with Swansea winger Daniel James, 21, the first to move to Old Trafford. Rooney, a former United and England top scorer, said: \"The club needs to be built around young players but they have to be good enough and I think the fans will understand that they may not be challenging for the league title next year.\" Let Ole build a team in two or three years that can challenge for the Premier League and the Champions League. It is the likes of Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham and especially Everton that will need two years to reach the level of Liverpool and Manchester City.

Rooney believes the defeat will help England in the future and hopes that manager Gareth Southgate will continue to help his team play from the back. ''Everyone was disappointed that the team failed to qualify, but they have young players,'' he said. It would have been better to lift the trophy, but there were mistakes made on and off the pitch by the players and the coaching staff. Southgate wanted to rest six players - three Liverpool players, Jordan Henderson, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joe Gomez, and Tottenham's Eric Dier, Harry Kane and Dele Alli - who played in the Champions League in the previous five days. Rooney said: \"If Gareth had been allowed to start he would have started the players who played in the Champions League. \"I would have started them. They were in good form and Liverpool were coming off a win and that could have made the difference.\" On the mistakes that had been made, he added: \"I don't think it will happen again and if it does and that's how the manager wants them to play then he will be held accountable. \"If I was in his place I would have pushed them to keep doing what they're doing.\""}

No team has been more impressive this season, both teams have been in a difficult period, and Real are currently in the Champions League competition after losing at home, there is much that can happen in this game that looks difficult and a win is highly sought after. These are the things that are being looked at in detail ahead of Sunday's clash. Can Benzema show wonders and lift Real? Something that has proven difficult for Real this season has been the difficulty of finding goals, which was evident last weekend when they beat Levante 1-0 while they have failed to find the net eight times this season. In the early stages of the cup competition, Karim Benzema was able to carry his team to a great extent. The Frenchman scored 13 goals in the first 16 games, most of them from inside the penalty area. But Benzema has scored just one league goal since Christmas, most notably in the last-gasp win over Atletico Madrid, and no player has been able to replace him. The statistics show that this season, excluding penalties, no Real player has scored more than three goals in the league. Sergio Ramos is the second-highest scorer with five, but three of those goals have come from penalties. The team's forwards have been underwhelming this season in terms of goals: Gareth Bale (scored twice in the league), Eden Hazard (1), Luka Jovic (2), Rodrygo (2) and Vinicius Junior (1) have all struggled this term, leaving midfielders like Toni Kroos and Fede Valverde, along with defender Ramos, to step up and provide the goals. So far, the lack of goals has been blamed on injuries and last weekend when they played Levante, they fell back again after attacking midfielder Eden Hazard was injured and returned from injury. This is different from when Real was managed by Zidane a few years ago, the team was not doing well but was not lacking goals. Many thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo who at times carried the team on his shoulders by deciding the game. Barca are suffering from injuries and the choice of squad Will Martin Braithwaite, who was signed a few weeks ago, be in the mix? Barcelona will be without their first-choice defenders Sergi Roberto and Jordi Alba due to injuries. Their places will be taken by the less-than-perfect defenders Nelson Semedo and Junior Firpo although there were fears for Gerard Pique after he was injured on Tuesday in the 1-1 draw with Napoli. Current manager Quique Setien has lined up a number of players to support star man Lionel Messi, who has been the star of the team this season, scoring 18 goals and providing 12 assists. In the midweek game against Napoli, Setien opted to field Messi and Antoine Griezmann in attack. In midfield, he fielded Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic, Frenkie de Jong and Arturo Vidal. He could choose the same line-up this weekend but only if the opportunity arises. La Liga standings so far"}

Fifa president Gianni Infantino last year said the plan to expand from 32 teams, which was due to start in 2026, would be pushed back to 2022. The change meant Qatar, the tournament's host, would have to partner with other countries in the region. The federation said \"after extensive consultations\" it had concluded the change \"could not be implemented as originally planned\". Fifa said it had assessed the feasibility of Qatar hosting the tournament on its own with 48 teams but decided to scrap the plan due to the challenge of not having enough time to \"conduct a review to determine the impact of the move, its consequences and how to address emerging issues\". A statement from Qatar's World Cup organisers said: \"Qatar was ready to implement the plan for the 2022 tournament and the progress made towards achieving the plan had been made by all stakeholders. Fifa president Gianni Infantino wants 48 teams to take part Infantino, 46, who succeeded fellow countryman Sepp Blatter as Fifa president in February 2016, campaigned on a promise to expand the tournament. He initially proposed a 40-team tournament, an idea put forward by then-UEFA president Michel Platini in 2013, before changing his position and backing a 48-team tournament. \"With three and a half years to go until the tournament, Qatar is committed to ensuring it delivers a World Cup in 2022 that the entire Arab region can be proud of.\" In November, Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said adding 16 teams to the 2022 tournament in Qatar would be \"problematic\" and added that the plan was \"unfeasible\". BBC Sports Editor Dan's analysis Roan Those close to the Qatar 2022 tournament organizers say a joint decision was reached between them and Fifa, but they have now decided to focus on 32 teams. Fifa's decision, however, has reduced the organizers' enthusiasm for partnering with other countries to host the world-famous tournament, given the ongoing hostility between the country and its neighbors. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have imposed sanctions on Qatar, and the move to host the tournament with them would have been controversial. The dispute between the countries left Qatar with the possibility of possibly partnering with Kuwait and Oman, but a Fifa study found that the countries were unable to meet its conditions. Infantino had previously consulted with Saudi Arabia when he proposed revamping the World Cup, and many suspected his suggestion that the country could be part of the solution to achieving a plan to expand the tournament to 2022. But following last year's allegations of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in its consulate in Istanbul, as well as its role in the Yemen conflict, Fifa would have been criticised by human rights defenders if it had been given the go-ahead to co-host the tournament with Qatar, as it would have been if the UAE had been given the chance because it is its main partner. Some national football federations, including Infantino, may be disappointed by the decision, but many others support the move. History of World Cup Changes"}

There are conflicting reports about the exact number of passengers on board the ferry..Initial reports suggested it may have been carrying up to 400 people..Ukerewe District Commissioner Colonel Lucas Maghembe had himself initially mentioned the number when he was interviewed by journalists after the incident..Colonel Maghembe said at the time that they estimated that the number of people who were able to swim or save themselves was about one hundred..The ship has a capacity to carry between 100 and 120 passengers but the district commissioner says it is difficult to determine the exact number of passengers on board..Tanzanian opposition leader Zitto Kabwe has called on the Tanzanian government to provide official information on the number of people on board the MV Nyerere when it sank..Mr Kabwe, who is the MP for Kigoma-Ujiji, said the lack of information on the exact number is a sign of the shortcomings of the country's new statistics law..\"Some people say the ferry had between 150 and 500 passengers.\".\"It is important that the Government issues an official statement on the number of passengers on board to clear up any confusion or that the Government promises not to prosecute any citizen who testifies to provide estimates to the People to strengthen rescue efforts,\" he said..Why were there so many passengers on Thursday? Thursday is a market day on Ukaya Island, meaning an open market, and it is reported that many people were traveling with their luggage and goods..This contributed to the ship, which is normally designed to carry around 100 people, being overloaded..It is normal for the ferry to carry many people on Thursdays.According to the Citizen newspaper, the MV Nyerere ferry has the capacity to carry 100 passengers, 25 tons of cargo and three small vehicles..In July this year, a new engine was installed after the previous one began to malfunction..The newspaper says MV Nyerere has been serving the Ukerewe area since 2004..How did the accident happen? Colonel Lucas Maghembe says that at around 7:30 in the afternoon, as the ship was approaching the shore, when the captain began to slow down the ship, people ran to one side, wanting to be the first to leave the ship..This caused the weight to shift to one side and the ship began to tilt and eventually capsize..It turned completely and her butt was facing upwards.Some people swam and others were rescued by canoes..MV Nyerere: Hopes of finding more survivors have faded. Investigations are still ongoing to determine the exact cause of the accident..Among the dead are the captain and three crew members.One worker survived in critical condition and was hospitalized..Colonel Maghembe has said that if it is found that there are those who caused the accident, perhaps by committing sabotage, disciplinary measures will be taken.Mwanza Regional Police Commander, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Jonathan Shana, speaking to Mwananchi newspaper, said the ferry sank while heading to Ukara Island..He says the ferry left Bugolora at 6pm and when it arrived at exactly 8pm it capsized..Why were rescue efforts suspended Thursday night? Rescue officials Rescue officials called off further rescue efforts due to darkness around 2 p.m..Colonel Maghembe also says that the people who were helping with the rescue using canoes were tired..Official rescue efforts began around 4pm after rescue experts arrived from Mwanza..By the time rescue efforts were called off, 44 bodies had been recovered, and 37 people had been safely evacuated..32 were hospitalized and seven were safely discharged home..Colonel Maghembe says rescuers were carrying out rescue operations and had also entered the ship and inspected it, finding that there were no signs of people being found alive..The darkness was disturbing..Has Magufuli said anything? Tanzanian President Dr. John Magufuli had not made a direct statement about the tragedy on Thursday but on Friday he addressed the nation through the Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation (TBC) where he declared four days of mourning..President Magufuli has also ordered the formation of an investigation commission to determine the cause of the accident and ordered that all those involved in causing the accident be arrested and brought to justice..\"Preliminary reports have clearly shown that the MV Nyerere ferry was overloaded with people and cargo. If anyone has evidence of the cause of this accident, we expect them to take it to court,\" he said..Dr. Magufuli has sent his Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa to the disaster area..His initial message was, through the Tanzanian government spokesman who is also the Director of Presidential Communications at the State House, Gerson Msigwa, who had offered condolences to those affected by the tragedy..\"The President apologizes to the family, relatives, friends and relatives who were affected by the accident.\"The President is appealing to Tanzanians to remain calm while rescue efforts continue and later the Government will be able to provide an update on what will happen,\" he said when he called the Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation (TBC). Residents came out to monitor rescue efforts. Mr Msigwa also sent condolences to the victims on behalf of the government on Thursday evening..He wrote on Twitter: \"On behalf of the Government, I express my condolences to those who lost their relatives and friends in the accident involving the sinking of the MV Nyerere pontoon owned by the Technical and Electrical Agency (Temesa) which provides services to the islands of Ukerewe and Ukara.\".\"The government through Temesa will continue to provide further information at this time as efforts are directed primarily at rescue operations and other humanitarian services.\".\"Later on Friday, Mr Msigwa tweeted a quote from President Magufuli who said he was deeply shocked by the accident..\"I am shocked and deeply saddened by the MV Nyerere accident.

At this time, I ask that we remain calm while rescue efforts continue,\" he said..MV Nyerere while it was operating Kenyatta, Kagame and Odinga: Those who sent condolences from this region Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent condolences to President Magufuli and Tanzanians in general due to the tragedy.He said Kenyans are with their \"brothers\" Tanzanians during this difficult time..Kenyan opposition leader, former prime minister Raila Odinga, has sent condolences to those affected by the ferry disaster in Tanzania..He said he is mourned by Tanzanians during this difficult time and prayed to God to give strength to all those affected, as well as all Tanzanian citizens..Rwandan President Paul Kagame has also sent condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims of the Mwanza ferry disaster.."}
{"instruction": "Please summarize the content in one sentence.\nCoronavirus: UK to start using coronavirus vaccine\nThe UK's MHRA has said the vaccine, which offers 95% protection against Covid-19, is safe to use. The vaccine will be available in the coming days, with priority given to high-risk groups. The UK has ordered 40 million doses, enough for 20 million people, each to receive two doses. About 10 million doses will be available soon. The vaccine has been approved for use faster than any other vaccine, taking just 10 months, compared to decades that normally take to be approved. Even though the vaccine is ready for use, people will still need to follow the rules for protecting themselves against the coronavirus, experts have said. This includes social distancing, wearing masks and getting tested. What is this vaccine? It is a new type of vaccine called mRNA that uses genetic information from the virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. The mRNA vaccine has never been approved for human use before, although people have been receiving it in clinical trials. The vaccine must be kept at around 70 degrees Celsius and will be shipped in special boxes, packed with dry ice. Once it arrives in the region, it can be kept for up to five days in the fridge. Who will get the vaccine and when? Experts have drawn up a preliminary list, focusing on people who are most at risk if they get coronavirus. At the very top of the list are people living in care homes and their caregivers, followed by people over 80 and other social and health workers. They will receive the first batch of the vaccine - some of them getting it next week. Vaccination of the majority of people over 50 will follow, along with young people with chronic health conditions. More batches of the vaccine could be available in 2021. The vaccine is given in two injections 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster dose. What about Covid vaccines? There are a number of other vaccines that are hoped to be approved soon. Starting with Moderna, which uses a similar mRNA name, while Pfizer's vaccine also offers similar protection. The UK has pre-ordered 7 million doses of the vaccine, which could be ready by April next year. The UK has ordered 100 million doses of different Covid vaccines from Oxford University and AstraZeneca. The vaccine uses a harmless virus, modified to be more similar to the virus that causes Covid-19. Russia has been using another vaccine, called Sputnik, and the Chinese military has approved another vaccine made by CanSino Biologics. They all work in a similar way to the Oxford vaccine. Which Pfizer/BioNtech company is this? Pfizer/BioNtech is the first drug company to release details about the final phase of its vaccine trial. The results suggest the vaccine can protect people from Covid-19 by 90 percent. Nearly 43,000 people have been given the vaccine and no safety concerns have been reported. Moderna has tested its vaccine on 30,000 people in the United States, half of whom received the experimental shot. It says its vaccine provides 94.5 percent protection after being administered to the first five of 95 people who showed symptoms of Covid infection to receive the vaccine."}

Thousands of years ago, humans were amazed and wondered what was found on this planet located 54 million kilometers away.6 from Earth (34 million miles).Very, due to its appearance of red color similar to rusted metal, people associated it with fire or blood.The name Mars comes from the Roman god of war..Due to scientific achievements, humanity has now succeeded in understanding a lot about this planet..This planet has an amazing landscape: you will find areas similar to those on Earth, deserts due to strong winds, huge craters caused by volcanoes, volcanic mountains and areas the size of the country of Luxembourg filled with sand mountains..All of this is covered in one-color dust.Mars has beautiful sand dunes. It is a place where it never rains..It is impossible to have rain because water, if it were present, would evaporate immediately..On Mars, at the same time as sunset on Earth, the sky is filled with blue..The Earth appears as just a dot among the stars in the sky..It's a very attractive landscape, especially for those who love tourism - considering that humans haven't visited the planet much, there's a guarantee that if you manage to get there, you'll be the first human to do so wherever you go..You will be like the Europeans who visited Africa in the 19th century, where they were the first Europeans to see the beautiful mountains, rivers, deserts and forests of the continent..But remember that there is no oxygen.How will you get there? For centuries, it has been just a dream but it is about to come true..If all goes well, Space X entrepreneur Elon Musk plans to send the first group of tourists to the planet by 2022..But its cost will probably surprise you..The ticket is $10bn! But if you can't make that much money, don't despair..There is another technological approach that the US space agency Nasa is considering - using modern glasses and robots..The robot will be Mars, you will be right here on Earth but it will be streaming you realistic images from that planet..Attractions on Mars The main attraction is the mountain Olympus Mons.This mountain is 14 miles (22 kilometers) high, and is the tallest volcanic mountain in the Solar System..For comparison, the height of this mountain is three times the height of the tallest mountain in the world, Mount Everest..Like many of the world's tallest volcanoes, this mountain's summit is covered in clouds - but not of water, but of dust..It is not known whether this mountain still erupts, but it is estimated that it once erupted, spewing mud and large fiery rocks into the sky..If you travel southwest from this mountain, you will find Valles Marineris..This is a large valley on the equator of Mars..This basin is estimated to be 4,000 kilometers long, which is almost the width of the United States from east to west..In some places, this canyon is nearly seven kilometers (23,000 feet) deep - almost four times the depth of the famous American canyon known in English as the Grand Canyon..Many mountains on Mars have small rivers that are thought to be the result of salty water seeps. So far, it has not been determined how such a large valley was formed..This Valles Marineris valley has beautiful, colorful sand arranged in layers..It is thought that this sand may have originated from sediments or mud that accumulated at the bottom of a glacial lake or river, or from the accumulation of volcanic ash..Unlike the Grand Canyon in the United States, which was formed by erosion that carved out sand and rock, this Martian valley is likely the result of the separation of two large areas of Mars' 'land'..Each side of the valley can be accessed from the other, as if someone is completing a puzzle game..The color of the sky At sunset, the sky is blue. If you manage to find yourself in this valley, and you want to watch the sunset, you will be surprised to discover that its sky will not be red - but blue..This is due to the lightness of Mars' atmosphere, which is only one percent of the weight of Earth's atmosphere..The Earth's sky appears blue during the day due to sunlight being scattered by air molecules..This doesn't happen much on Mars, so during the day the sky is a yellowish color, almost brown..But when the sun sets, when its rays are not as strong, the Martian sky turns blue..The planet Mars also has another amazing thing..In many places, beneath its red dust, there are blue and green rocks from minerals such as iron..When the dust is carried by the wind or by the passing of a small planet, a beautiful landscape of different shades of blue is revealed..Climate The average temperature on Mars is about -56C (-69F)..This is similar to the cold conditions in the deepest parts of Antarctica, says David Catling, a biologist and astrophysicist at the University of Washington..To enjoy it, you'll have to stay near Mars' equator, where temperatures can reach around 35C (95F), and there's not much wind..Due to the lightness of its atmosphere, strong winds there will feel like just a breeze. Although there is often humidity and fog at night on the planet, the day is very dry..Due to the fact that the planet is located about one and a half times farther from the sun than Earth, there is no need to wear sunglasses to protect against sunlight..There, starting a fire is also a chore as there are no plants and its atmosphere is 96 percent carbon dioxide - a chemical used in many fire extinguishers..Unlike Earth, where clouds and sky act as a blanket and prevent heat from escaping at night, Mars has no clouds and its sky is very clear..The result is that, just like in the desert, it gets very cold at night..This cold can reach -73C (-99F) at night near the planet's equator..Are there living things? This robot took the first selfie on Mars. All living things on Earth have water in them..Therefore, experts have long believed that if there are organisms on Mars, they must be in areas with water.. For decades, scientists searched for signs of water on Mars without success. But in 2011, they made the discovery.They discovered streams of water flowing from the mountains and valleys of Mars.It is thought that rivers, perhaps with salty water, may spring from underground 'into' a vast reservoir of water..Do humans evolve? Due to the low gravity, the weight of objects varies on Mars.A human weighing about 100 kg would weigh about 38 kg on Mars..If you successfully land on Mars, you will be looking at the Earth and seeing it as a drop or center in the sky.Earth will look similar to how we see Venus in the early morning, or evening sky, says Catling."}

United are in second place in the English league and are in the semi-finals of the FA Cup but were eliminated in the Champions League last week. Former Arsenal striker Ian Wright told BBC Radio 5 live he would not prefer to play under Mourinho right now. United are 16 points behind Manchester City in the league with eight games remaining and will face Tottenham next month to reach the FA Cup final. But while City has managed to score 85 goals in the English league this season, United has scored only 58 goals, which is the fewest among the top four teams in the league according to the table. The Red Devils were knocked out of the European Cup by Sevilla, who won 2-1 at Old Trafford, while City and Liverpool progressed to the quarter-finals. Speaking on Monday, Sutton said: Mourinho has changed personally from what he was in 2004. He focuses on silly little issues. Is it a disaster for Man United now? Nope. But that was the goal of Mourinho coming to Man United and finishing behind City and not having the spirit to compete for major titles? he is out of date. He looks at City and their style of football and Liverpool. This is a man who was signed by Man United because he seemed to be talented. Now he looks outdated due to the style of his game and the way other teams play. Didier Drogba is among the players who are said to be uncomfortable at Old Trafford. The 55-year-old Mourinho won the English league three times, twice as Chelsea coach. He succeeded Louis van Gaal as United manager in May 2016 and has won the EFL and European Cups in his first season. Wright blames the trainer for bringing darkness to the club. The former England striker said: I don't know what has been done to him. The club brought Mourinho to bring quality, he has spent a lot of money but he is arguing with everyone. Manchester City play a style of football that is beautiful and visible. Is Shaw being abused? After United scored with all their attacks on goal as they beat Brighton 2-0 in the FA Cup sixth round on Saturday, Mourinho said his side were afraid to play. Left back Luke Shaw was one of the players mentioned and criticized by the coach after he said that he was not happy with the player's level. The English player who has played for United 15 times this season was introduced since February. Is he being abused? asked Sutton. I don't like the word 'harassment' in football because there are always strong feelings in the preparation room, especially from the coach. There are words used by the coach to criticize the players. This issue has been happening since football started. Everyone is different. In terms of coaching, they have the right to make sure they get to know each player behaviorally. Wright said that Mourinho should do everything to ensure that Luke Shaw's game improves after the player broke his right leg twice in September 2015. He said: He broke his leg and now he looks heavy but that doesn't mean he can't go up and down down in its abundance. I don't know his personal life but it is impossible that every time the trainer comes back to remind him. Mourinho should strengthen the 22-year-old player who may participate in the world cup with the England team. Mourinho said in April that Shaw used his body instead of his mind during the 1-1 draw against Everton According to BBC Sport's Simon Stone on BBC Radio 5 live: Mourinho's criticism has angered Shaw. He is angry with that action. I can't say enough about how upset his people were. He was recently suffering from a leg injury and it is not the first time that Mourinho has criticized him, others keep their heads down but it is claimed that it was personal. Michael Carrick has been at United for about 12-13 years and is expected to join the team's coaching department. If there is someone who should defend Shaw then it should be Carrick. It is good to see what the goals will be. It's not the preparation room of four or five years ago when there were players like Patrice Evra, Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand who would sit down with Furgusson and tell him there was a complicated issue."}

From 4:30 p.m. The event will last for 51 minutes and 1 minute, when the completion of the historic event will begin and then continue until 6:13 p.m. when it will end. The event will be the longest of the 21st century, according to NASA. And if you are lucky, you will be able to see the event for 1 hour and 43 minutes. What is a lunar eclipse? A lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, Earth and moon are in a straight line. This means that the Earth is between the sun and the moon, blocking the sunlight. The eclipse occurs when the moon enters the Earth's shadow. In different phases, the lunar eclipse will last for 3 hours and 55 minutes. The night of a lunar eclipse is associated with the phenomenon of the existence of a 'blood moon' due to its red color. Why is it called a 'blood moon'? The night of a lunar eclipse is associated with the concept of a 'blood moon' due to its red color. This is due to the effects of viewing the sun's rays in the sky and the orange and red colors seen on the moon. At the same time, during the lunar eclipse on July 27, the moon will be further and further from the earth. When and where will it be visible? The lunar eclipse on July 27 will be visible in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, central Asia and Australia, all except the northern United States. You will not need a telescope to view the moon. The shadow of the event will be visible on satellites without blocking all the light. In the UK, you will not be able to see the beginning of the event. Who will see it best? The best places to view the event are the eastern half of Africa, the Middle East and central Asia. The event will not be visible in central and North America. In the southern United States, it can be seen partially in the eastern regions, especially in the cities of Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. In other nearby cities, you will see the moon as it leaves the area - that is, the line where the earth and sky appear to meet. The shadow of the event will be visible in satellites without blocking out all the light. In the UK, you will not be able to see the beginning of the event, that is because the moon will be below the horizon."}

US allies have been angered by President Trump's recent move to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium products, a move that has raised fears of a trade war. It is not clear whether a joint agreement will be made public after the summit concludes later on Saturday. The two-day summit is being held in the Quebec city of La Malbaie. Mr Trump is expected to leave on Saturday for a crucial meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. According to the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins, in Quebec, the meeting got off to a rocky start and could end without a deal being reached. The differences between Trump and the other six leaders go beyond trade - they include climate change, relations with Iran and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. President Trump is accompanied by British Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel German Chancellor Angela Merkel is among those who say it would be better to lay out their differences publicly rather than pretending that they are united. ''It's more honest,'' she said. ''Instead of pretending that everything is fine.'' Others believe that a compromise can be reached and President Trump says he is hopeful of a solution. But there is no doubt about Mr Trump's isolation. He does not like to negotiate with groups and will leave before the meeting is over, heading to Singapore to meet Kim Jong Un face-to-face as he wants. Why the difference? The last G7 summit under President Barack Obama On June 1, the United States imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imported from the EU, Canada and Mexico. Mr Trump said the move would protect domestic producers who are vital to the country's security. The European Union later announced tariffs on US goods ranging from Harley-Davidson motorcycles to bourbon. Canada and Mexico are also planning retaliatory measures. On Friday, Canada's foreign minister called the tariffs illegal. European Council President Donald Tusk said the tariffs threatened international law. British Prime Minister Theresa May urged Europe to exercise restraint. French President Emmanuel Macron said he believed all sides wanted to reach an agreement. Who left a mark on President Donald Trump at the G7 summit? What is the G7? It is an annual meeting that brings together the countries of Canada, the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Japan and Germany, which together account for 60% of global trade. The economy is the main agenda, although the summit also covers important global issues. Russia was expelled from the summit in 2014 after it invaded and annexed Crimea from Ukraine. On Friday, Mr Trump made a surprise request to Russia to be reinstated, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel said some members opposed the idea."}

Some of the bail conditions are that each suspect must have two sureties plus 20 million shillings, equivalent to about 9000 US dollars. Retired Prime Minister Edward Lowassa is among the members and senior Chadema leaders who arrived to monitor the progress of the case facing Mbowe and other party leaders. Supporters of the party also gathered outside the Kisutu court in Dar es Salaam awaiting the court's decision on the appeal. Chadema leader Freeman Mbowe (right) is one of those charged. The leaders were arrested on Tuesday this week and brought to court where they face eight charges including incitement and gathering in a public meeting without a permit. Initially, the government lawyer Faraja Nchimbi said their first offense was organizing illegal gatherings or demonstrations. Among the charges read to them were the protests that led to the death of NIT student Akwilina Akwiline. They are also accused of continuing to hold illegal gatherings in Kinondoni district, a charge facing all the accused. All the accused denied all the charges against them, while Lawyer Nchimbi claimed that the investigation into the case had been completed and requested a date for the reading of the initial statements. Initially, through the press officer of Tumaini Makene, the party strongly condemned the arrest of their leaders and said ''It has become a circus against the opposition...we will not be able to remain silent about these plots against our leaders, we will continue to condemn them and we are looking into the possibility of taking legal action''.

The main opposition party Chadema is the one that seems to have the largest number of its politicians facing various cases. Singida MP, through the Chadema party Tundu Lissu who is currently in Belgium for medical treatment, is facing six cases. All the cases are related to incitement. Lissu is said to be the politician who has been arrested more times than others. Among his cases that have raised a lot of debate both locally and internationally is the one where he was accused of making inflammatory statements and calling President John Magufuli a 'dictator of uchwara'. Joseph Mbilinyi, popularly known by his artwork Sugu, who is the MP for Mbeya city, has now been in prison for five months after the court found him guilty of using abusive language against President Magufuli. For her part, Halima Mdee, the MP for Kawe constituency in Dar es Salaam, has four cases, all of which are for sedition, including the one where she was accused of using bad language to oppose President Magufuli after the announcement of a ban on allowing female students to return to school once they become pregnant. Arusha MP Godbless Lema is also facing four cases, all of which are for sedition. In the past, Lema was detained for four months for sedition. Currently, Lema has been attending court regularly. Chadema national chairman and leader of the official opposition camp in parliament, Freeman Mbowe, has 3 cases, including this week's case. He is currently required to attend the police every day. John Mnyika, the MP for Ubungo constituency in Dar es Salaam, has been required to attend the police every week since the party's attempted protest last month. This case has not yet been made public. Mara MP, Esther Bulaya, was once arrested by the police for attempting to organize a public rally outside her constituency, which the police claimed was a violation of the law."}

A group of teenagers went to a railway station to take selfies in front of oncoming trains. But two of them were late getting off the tracks and were run over by the train, police said. A study last year found that India has seen more selfie-related deaths than any other country. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and the Indraprastha Institute of Communication in Delhi say that of the 127 deaths attributed to selfies between 2014 and 2015, 76 were reported in India. The latest incident came to light after local media reported it on Tuesday. \"While taking a picture, they saw a train coming and moved aside. But another train came from the opposite direction and they got stuck in the middle. They were hit by one of the trains,\" the Indian Express quoted a police officer as saying. A railway police official added that the youths had hired a professional photographer for the job. \"We have recovered the camera from the youths which was used. You had pictures and videos. The videos are being examined, while the pictures prove that they were jumping from one rail to another,\" Deputy Commissioner of Police Parwaiz Ahmed told the Hindustan Times. Last year, two students drowned while taking selfies in a flooded river in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. And the Mumbai police have listed 15 places where it is 'dangerous' to take selfies after an 18-year-old girl drowned in the sea while taking a selfie."}

Why are there a large number of women working for the Mossad? These are some of the questions that many people ask but do not get answers. However, a closer examination of the actions and statements of those who have worked for the agency will give you a picture of how the Mossad works. First, the Mossad uses unique and trained agents to achieve its goals in its operations around the world. Here are some of the reasons that make the Mossad a unique intelligence agency for Israel Women have unique abilities In 2017, the Mossad issued an advertisement seeking female agents. The agency already has 40 percent of women working for it, with 24 percent holding senior leadership positions, according to local media reports. Women have been hailed as the best secret agents by a former Mossad chief. Tamir Pardo said in 2012 that female agents “have a distinct advantage in covert warfare because of their ability to multitask” and “hide their behavior to achieve their goals,” according to The Jerusalem Post. “Contrary to popular belief, you see that women are better than men in terms of understanding the terrain, studying conditions, understanding the environment. When you get the best ones, they are very good,” the agency’s then-chief said. During the recruitment drive three years ago, the Mossad website told aspiring recruits that “It’s not about what you’ve done, it’s about who you are.” When was Mossad founded? • Israel’s international intelligence agency was founded in 1949 • It is one of the most feared and most notorious secret intelligence services in the world. All its officers have been praised for exceptional operations and are even accused of brutal murders • It first proved its global reach by arresting Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Argentina in 1960 Iran complains If there is a country that blames Mossad for every misfortune that befalls it, then Iran is first on the list. It has blamed Mossad for the murder of its scientists who were running its nuclear weapons program. On January 10, 2011, Iran announced that it had arrested 10 of its citizens for the murder of Professor Massoud Ali Mohammadi. Iran's Intelligence Ministry said that the 10 suspects worked in collaboration with Mossad. Iranian state television broadcast an alleged confession from one of the arrested men, named Majid Jamali Fashi. The suspected agent was shown speaking in a darkened room. Mr. Jamali Fashi explained that, about three years ago, he was supposed to go to the Israeli Consulate in Istanbul. The reason for the visit is unknown. But he did, and he said that he was interrogated by Israeli agents. \"They asked me all the details of my life in detail. And also, they gave me guarantees to cooperate with them in their plans and asked me to gather information from inside Iran.\" This is just one example of how the Mossad managed to turn many Iranian citizens into its agents and begin collecting intelligence on behalf of Israel. After several months of training, his interrogators told him that he had a job to do and told him that he should target him - Massoud Ali Mohammadi, a professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Tehran. He explained that they wanted him to plant a motorcycle bomb outside the professor's house, and that is how the Iranian scientist was killed. Since that incident, there have been many cases of Iranian scientists being killed in suspicious circumstances and Iran has always blamed Israel for their murders. Supported by the United States Another thing that has made the Mossad organization successful is how the nation of Israel is protected by the United States. The Israeli government is aware of how it is protected diplomatically by the United States and has therefore gained the strength to be able to do anything without fear of repercussions. When there are complaints from other countries about Mossad operations or allegations of assassinations, international sanctions or even from the United Nations cannot be directed at Israel because of the United States' intervention and protection. It also does not help that Iran, which is hostile to the United States, has been targeting Israel through militant groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah. This makes the United States see Israel and its Mossad organization as the best option to be used to deal with the threats posed by Iran to the interests of the United States and other Western countries."}

Coughs often clear up on their own within two to three weeks. The new advice to doctors aims to reduce the problem of antibiotics not working. Overuse of antibiotics makes it harder to treat infections, as they create a barrier that prevents the drugs from working. 'Big Problem' A hot drink with honey, often with lemon and ginger, is a popular drink for treating coughs and colds, but the tea is also made at home. New advice from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Public Health England (PHE) says there is little evidence that it can help improve cough symptoms. Cough medicines containing pelargonium, guaifenesin or dextromethorphan may also be helpful, they say. Patients are advised to use these remedies and wait for symptoms to clear up before starting antibiotics. Tablets Coughs are often caused by bacteria that cannot be treated with antibiotics but go away on their own. But despite this recognition, research shows that 48% of GPs prescribe antibiotics to treat coughs or colds. Dr Tessa Lewis, who chairs the group that provides clinical guidance, said: \"If the cough gets worse rather than better, or the patient continues to feel unwell and is unable to breathe, then the patient should see a doctor.\" The draft recommendations are part of new proposals for antimicrobial prescribing rules being developed jointly by PHE and NICE. England's Chief Medical Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, has previously warned about the persistence of antimicrobials. When these drugs fail to work, infections become harder to treat, and standard treatments for diseases such as cancer and organ transplants become more risky, Professor Davies warned. The deadline for collecting comments on the regulations is September 20."}

The earliest ancestors lived there for 70,000 years, until the climate there changed, researchers suggest. They began to move as fertile land became available, contributing to the migration of subsequent generations out of Africa. \"It has been clear for some time now that, biologically, modern humans were present in Africa around 200,000 years ago,\" says Prof Vanessa Hayes, a geneticist at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Australia. \"What has been debated for a long time is the specific location where they arose and the subsequent dispersal of their ancestors.\" However, Professor Hayes's final statement has drawn skepticism from other researchers in the field. The main lake fortress The area in question is south of the Zambezi River in northern Botswana. Researchers think our ancestors settled near Africa's largest lake system, Lake Makgadikgadi, which is now a salt flat. \"It's a huge area, it would have been very wet, and it would have been a very attractive place to live,\" says Prof Hayes. \"And it would have been a good place for modern humans and animals to live.\" After living there for 70,000 years, people began to leave. Changes in the way rainfall falls in the area contributed to three waves of migration between 130,000 and 110,000 years ago, driven by the opening up of more fertile land. Prof Hayes learns how to make fire with Jul'hoansi hunters in the Kalahari region of Namibia The first wave of migrants headed northeast, followed by a second wave of migrants traveling southwest and a third of the population remains in the region to this day. The picture is based on looking back at human family structures using hundreds of DNA samples from the maternal lineage of living Africans. By combining genetics with geology and by simulating computer and weather models, the researchers were able to create a picture of what the African continent was like 200,000 years ago. Reconstructing the human story However, the study, published in the journal Nature, has been criticized by one expert, who says you can't reconstruct the story of human origins from DNA alone. Other analyses have given different answers using fossil finds to suggest their origins in East Africa. Professor Chris Stringer of the National Museum of Natural History in London, who was not involved in the study, said the evolution of early humans, Homo sapiens, was a complex system. \"You can't use mitochondrial DNA distribution alone to identify a single origin for modern humans,\" he told the BBC. \"I think it's oversimplifying the data because you're only looking at one part of the structure so it doesn't give you a complete picture of our origins.\" So there could be many more origins or places where modern humans came from than just one, which have yet to be identified.

The much awaited meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim is expected to take place on June 12. This has come after North Korea said it is committed to ensuring that nuclear weapons are removed from the Korean peninsula. Preparations for the Trump-Kim meeting have been progressing, but now there is doubt about it. North Korea's state news agency KCNA quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan as saying that if the United States \"presses us and insists that we must unconditionally surrender our nuclear weapons, then we will no longer be interested in participating in the talks and will have to reconsider if we accept the expected meeting between the DPRK and the US, North Korea is officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Mr. Kim said \"It was very hopeful that the meeting would contribute to reducing anxiety on the Korean Peninsula and be an important step in creating a more hopeful future. \"However, it is very unfortunate that the United States is provoking us before the meeting by making surprising statements.\" Early on Wednesday, signs of concern began to emerge, as North Korea pulled out of planned talks with South Korea. The high-level officials of the countries were expected to meet in the border area where the forces are not allowed to discuss more details about the agreement that had been reached in the general meeting between the countries last month. But North Korea withdrew, saying it was upset by the large-scale military exercises being organized between South Korea and the United States. The military exercise, named Max Thunder, was expected to take place during the Winter Olympics, but was postponed after hopes of improved relations between South and North Korea emerged. North Korea had previously said it knew the military operation would continue. But KCNA has now said that the military exercises are \"aggression\" and preparations for an invasion, a reference to the harsh language used during hostilities between the US and South Korea."}

The bodies were discovered on Sunday and the incident took place on Wednesday of last week. No rebel group has come forward to claim responsibility for the killings. But the region is known for ethnic warfare between the Hema and Lundu communities. Fighting between the two tribes has led to the deaths of more than 100 people and more than 300,000 others crossing Lake Albert and seeking refuge as refugees in Uganda. Peace in Eastern DRC Although almost all parts of the DRC have been plagued by security challenges such as war or frequent attacks by rebels, the eastern part of the country has been the most affected. Speaking to the BBC a few days before leaving office at the end of 2018, the country's former president, Joseph Kabila, said that among the things he would have more time to deal with is restoring peace to the country. In the east of the DRC, there are too many armed and ethnic rebel groups. Some groups are controlled by the country's citizens, but there are other large groups that are funded or fight the governments of neighboring countries. Some of the rebel groups that originate in other countries are the FDLR, which carried out the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 and whose fighters fled to the DRC. The ADF rebels originate in Uganda. These rebel groups use the dense forests in the area to hide and conduct their activities while declaring their intention to attack the countries they fled from. Uganda and Rwanda have invaded the DRC twice with the aim of disintegrating these groups and the wars that have led to the deaths of millions of people. The United Nations (UN) peacekeeping forces are in eastern DRC. The eastern part of the DRC is also facing a serious Ebola outbreak, one of the reasons for the failure to fully address it is the presence of these rebel groups. In March this year, the international news agency Reuters reported that the Mai Mai rebel group attacked an Ebola treatment camp, killing police and expelling all patients and health workers. These groups have also been accused of raping women in the areas they attack, making rape one of the biggest problems facing the region. The presence of these rebel groups has prompted the United Nations to deploy a special force (MONUSCO) to maintain peace. However, many analysts have been criticizing these forces for failing to carry out their duties properly."}

The iPhone 7 will instead use Apple's Lightning technology, which will allow one to use a single port to connect the phone to other devices. Apple will also allow the use of wireless headphones, and has released its own type of earphones known as Airpods. The company said it took courage to take the step. However, the move may upset some customers who will now have to buy an adapter to use the headphones. The US company launched its new phone at an event in San Francisco, USA. This comes after a year of falling iPhone sales and a decline in the company's market share. Other features: The launch of the phones comes just days after the European Commission ruled that Apple should pay €13bn (£11bn) in back taxes to Ireland, a decision that Apple has appealed. The iPhone 7's home button will vibrate to send a message to an Airpod user The 3.5mm headphone jack was popularized by Sony's Walkman music players, but was first used in Japanese-made radios in 1964. Apple has often hinted at its desire to ditch the old connectors and other devices before its rivals. But this time it didn't get there first. Lenovo's Moto Z and other devices from China's LeEco were launched without the 3.5mm headphone jack earlier this year. Apple said removing the 3.5mm headphone jack would free up space for other accessories. The AirPods will cost around £159. The AirPods have a built-in charging case that can be recharged. The AirPods also have the ability to detect when they are inserted into the ear. This allows them to pause music when they are removed. You can also control them using the Siri app. However, they must be charged separately, although Apple says they can stay charged for up to five hours. Its storage device allows one to use it for up to 24 hours. Dual cameras Having two lenses allows the iPhone 7 Plus to bring the subject closer to the subject The price of the iPhone 7 will range from £599 to £799, depending on its storage capacity. For the iPhone 7 Plus it is from £719 to £919. The initial price on the market for the iPhone 6S was £539 and the iPhone 6S Plus was £619, although its storage capacity was lower.

The study was carried out by the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). Confirmation of this new temperature record will have to wait until the full results of the study are published on Monday next week. Is this increase in temperature evidence of climate change? Prof. Peter Stott - Head of the UK's weather forecasting department says: \"If it is normal weather that is not polluted by humans, we can see a single warming but when we see extreme warming then it is due to climate change and humans may have contributed to it.'' Some scientists say it is a clear sign that the world is facing a climate emergency. The new report compiled by C3S includes the results of observations from satellites and ground stations. July's temperatures are estimated to be the highest ever recorded by the agency in 40 years. According to Copernicus, every month this year has been among the four warmest months compared to the month it has monitored and has broken records. Although researchers have not directly linked the rise in temperatures to climate change, some scientists believe the rise in carbon emissions from human activities is partly to blame. Thousands of firefighters battle wildfires in Portugal in July Global warming made June the hottest month on record, prompting scientists and environmentalists to warn of a climate emergency. \"It was a hot month, but not only that, but all of 2019 has seen high temperatures,\" Dr Freja Vamborg from Copernicus told the BBC. \"And that trend is unlikely to change unless greenhouse gas emissions are addressed.\" Temperatures have been rising around the world since the last century, but the past four years have been particularly hot."}

There has been a buzz after Makonda announced the plan to register all marriages in the region in order to tackle men who cheat women sexually. ''As a leader, you get different information from the citizens giving their thoughts, the challenges that exist and one of the tasks we have is to think of the best way to solve it''. Makonda said their goal is only one, that there is no one entering into an agreement without being informed about their partner.'' ''What we are thinking about is the way in our region that women are being lured by people with their families while knowing they are not in a relationship when those people are in a relationship''. According to Makonda, the Marriage Act gives a woman the right to go to court and be compensated for the loss she suffered for the time she was wasted by a man. ''This marriage law has always existed, it is not Makonda's law, it was enacted by the Parliament of the United Republic of Tanzania, it is just a matter of educating the public about the rights a woman has when she is married to a man''. He said. ''People who enter into such relationships find themselves having children and at the end of the day, even if the father dies, the child is rejected and expelled as a child who is not worthy of even saying goodbye to his father''. The announcement has been received with mixed feelings by residents of the city, some supporting the efforts of the regional commissioner in fighting love scammers, but others seeing that these are very personal issues while doubting whether the plan will be successful. What does the announcement say? Mr. Makonda said there is a plan to establish a database of all existing marriages in his region to reduce fraud committed against women by being tricked into getting married. The database will involve the registration of all marriages so that married men can be identified and help women not be cheated and hurt by relying on marriage. Makonda said that along with the data, he will use the SADC meeting to gain experience from other countries to understand how they deal with such fraud. This is not the first time for the Dar es Salaam regional commissioner to try to help solve the problems facing women in Dar es Salaam. In April 2018, Makonda issued an order for women who claim to have been abandoned by their partners to come to his office to be heard. And the next day, hundreds of people who had been abandoned by their partners showed up at the grounds of his office. A move that has been criticized as not bearing fruit."}

The Delhi government says it has not yet received data from any scientific study on water resources - for the study of supply, systems or water quality - carried out on the Brahmaputra river, which originates in China during this period, contrary to the agreement. One of Asia's great rivers, the Brahmaputra, rises in Tibet and empties into India before entering Bangladesh, where it joins smaller tributaries and ends in Bengal. The Beijing government has said that its water facilities are being upgraded, which means it cannot share its data with other countries. But the BBC has learned that China continues to share data on the river with Bangladesh. The issue of data on the river between China and India comes after the two countries ended a dispute over a disputed Himalayan border that lasted more than two months. The border dispute between China and India has been unresolved for several years. The Brahmaputra River floods every winter, causing widespread damage in northeastern India and Bangladesh. The two countries have an agreement with China that requires the river's source country to share data/information on the river with other countries during the winter season between May 15 and October 15. Normally, the data should be on the river's water level to alert other countries during floods. \"This year... We have not received any river water data from China since May 15,\" said Raveesh Kumar, a spokesperson for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, at a regular press briefing last month. \"We do not know the technical reasons for this, but there are mechanisms in place to enable China to provide us with river water data.\" \"Last year, due to the need for rehabilitation after the riverbanks were damaged by floods and the need to upgrade the technology of water stations in India, we were unable to collect the necessary data at this time,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a press conference last week. Bangladeshi officials, however, said they were still receiving data on the water level of the Brahmaputra from China. \"We received the water level data of the Brahmaputra from China a few days ago,\" Mofazzal Hossain, a member of the Bangladesh Joint River Commission, told the BBC. \"We have been receiving such data from the three water stations in Tibet since 2002 and they have continued to share the data with us even during the winter season,\" Mofazzal Hossain said. The river flows through India before entering Bangladesh. The Indian government has requested data on the flow of water in the Brahmaputra in other seasons, as there are concerns in India that China could divert water from the river to other states during the dry season. Residents of Dibrugarh in Assam, where the river is widest, say they have seen the water levels in the river drop sharply and rise sharply in a short period of time. Due to frequent floods and landslides in the Brahmaputra areas near the Himalayan mountains, all countries need data on the river's water levels to prevent disasters, especially during the winter season."}

{"instruction": "Please summarize the content in one sentence.\nTrump asked Australian PM to investigate Mueller\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is a close ally of US President Donald Trump. According to US and Australian media, Mr. Trump asked Morrison to help him with evidence that would undermine the investigation. Australia confirmed that the contacts between the leaders took place and that the Prime Minister agreed to carry out President Trump's request. The revelation comes as Mr. Trump faces an impeachment inquiry into his secret communications with another foreign leader. President Trump is believed to have asked his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy on July 25 to investigate former US Vice President Joe Biden in leaked phone calls. Former US Vice President Joe Biden The phone call between the two presidents took place just days after Trump ordered his administration to withhold $391 million in military aid to Ukraine. The calls have prompted Democratic lawmakers to launch an impeachment inquiry into President Trump. On Monday, the president's lawyer Rudy Giuliani was served with a subpoena to appear in court. The Washington Post reported that US Attorney General William Barr has held private talks with Italian and British intelligence officials to seek help in the investigation into special counsel Robert Mueller's report. The sources told the newspaper that Mr Barr visited Italy last week and that it was not his first visit. Why has Australia's move caused controversy? The phone calls between Mr Morrison and Mr Trump were known to a small group of White House aides, the reports said - a departure from the usual practice. Similar secrecy was seen during Mr Trump's phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart, raising questions about whether White House officials were trying to cover up or keep secret the president's communications with foreign leaders. The president's contacts with foreign leaders have come under close scrutiny since the investigation began. US President Donald Trump The Mueller report investigated whether Mr. Trump colluded with Russia to help him win the 2016 presidential election. The findings, released in April, did not find that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election. The findings, however, did not exonerate the president, with special counsel Robert Mueller's report detailing how the president went to great lengths to obstruct the investigation. What is the Mueller report? The Mueller report is a 22-month investigation into possible collusion between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia. The investigation was led by Mueller, who was appointed to lead the task force in 2017 after US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had tried to influence Trump to win the election. Mueller also investigated whether Trump interfered with the investigation when he ordered the investigation into his national security adviser Michael Flynn to be dropped, and later fired FBI Director James Comey. Flynn has admitted lying to the FBI about his ties to Russia. Attorney General William Barr has been accused of holding a press conference before releasing the report. This is a fundamental question: what should be the limit of the president's behavior? The 45th president has enjoyed breaking rules and regulations - some have claimed that his repeated attacks on Mueller led to interference and threats. He says the president is embarrassed and angry because he believes the investigation is undermining his office. But special counsel Robert Mueller has identified 10 circumstances in which a president has broken the law - one of the highest crimes under the US Constitution, the consequences of which could be removal from office. The Attorney General has said they are not crossing the threshold that would lead to impeachment. Mr. Mueller, however, says something else entirely: ''While this report does not conclude that the President committed any wrongdoing, it also does not mean that he is not culpable.'' But is that right? You can do whatever you want as long as it is not a legal error? At the end of this process, we can truly say that President Donald Trump has changed the presidency but the presidency has not changed him."}

Islands around the world have lost more than 75 percent of their bird, land and marine species in the past 500 years. Much of the loss has been driven by animals that were introduced by humans to the areas, such as cats and dogs. These domesticated animals, because they are not native to the areas, pose a major threat to native species. \"Eliminating predators from islands is one of the most important ways to reduce the risk of extinction for island species and protect biodiversity,\" said Dr Nick Holmes, from the Island Conservation group. Their study has identified 107 islands where removing predators would help save 9.4 percent of the world's threatened species. The Tristan albatross, found on Gough Island, is also threatened with extinction. Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at Birdlife International, said that if taken, the measures would go a long way to protecting \"unique species that are isolated and in their own habitats, found on remote islands.\" Some islands have already started implementing the culls. The largest rat eradication program was recently declared successful on the South Georgia Islands. Some culls have already taken place on islands. The British South Atlantic islands are completely rat-free for the first time in 200 years.

In 2000, Kim Jong-un's father invited Pope John Paul II to visit North Korea after the pope was quoted as saying it would be a miracle if he went there. However, the invitation by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung never materialized. According to media reports, the Vatican insisted that the pope's visit would be conditional on Catholic priests being accepted into North Korea. Is there religious freedom in North Korea? North Korea's constitution promises the right to worship and the state will not interfere with the guidelines set by churches. But in reality, there is no religious freedom, said Arnold Fang, a researcher with Amnesty International. A 2014 United Nations report found that Christians in the region are often persecuted and punished for publicly expressing their faith. According to NK News, the Catholic Church will continue to exist in North Korea even though the country has no official ties with the Vatican. The authority that governs the Catholic community is also considered to be non-Vatican. According to AFP and KCA, there are an estimated 3,000 Catholics nationwide, while the United Nations estimates the number at 800. North Korea has not commented on the foreign missionary visits. Kenneth Bae is an American pastor who led a Christian mission to North Korea and was imprisoned for 15 years with hard labor in 2013 and released in 2014 after suffering health problems."}

Speaking after his trip to Africa, the Pope addressed the issue of hardline Catholic priests who have been criticizing him. The men \"do not want the church to do good,\" but rather \"change popes, change styles, create new branches of the church,\" he said. U.S. Catholic leaders have criticized the Pope for his views. This is the first time the Pope has spoken openly about the possibility of a split within the Catholic Church, which has more than one billion followers worldwide. What did the Pope say? Pope Francis made the remarks on a plane returning to Rome after a trip to Madagascar, Mauritius and Mozambique. He had been asked by a reporter about attacks on him by conservative Catholic leaders, via U.S. television stations and websites. Pope Francis meets with faithful in Antananarivo, Madagascar Some Catholic leaders - especially in the United States but also in other parts of the world - have criticized the Pope for narrowing their faith, and have even called for his resignation. They are unhappy with his positions on the environment and immigration. But most of all they oppose his move to allow the divorced and remarried to receive the sacrament of baptism. \"I am not afraid of division,\" Pope Francis said, adding that much has happened in the history of the Catholic Church. \"I pray that division does not occur, because the health of the souls of many depends on the Church.\" Pope Francis has said that political ideology is tainting the way critics view him. \"The things I say on social issues are the same as what Pope John Paul said. I quote him and they say 'the pope has become more communist',\" he told reporters. He praised \"constructive criticism\", but not \"those who smile and play tricks on you\". \"The criticism came not only from the United States but from other places, including the Curia,\" he said, referring to the Catholic Church's governing body. Has the church ever split before? In its 2,000-year history, the Catholic Church has split several times, with the most notable split being in 1054, when the Eastern Orthodox Church broke away from Rome. The splits led to opposition to the Pope - with some claiming to be popes and refusing to accept Rome's authority. Most recently, the Archbishop of Paris Marcel Lefebvre ordained four bishops without the Pope's consent in 1988. See also: Pope Francis rebukes corrupt priests"}

The last King to rule Rwanda was King Kigeli V (Kigeli the Fifth) who was deposed in 1961. The king, who had been living in exile in the United States, has died. King Kigeli V was born on June 29, 1936 in the Kamembe region of southwestern Rwanda as the son of King Yuhi V Musinga, and Queen Mukashema. He was of the Tutsi ethnic group. At the time of his birth, his father had been deposed by the Belgians on suspicion of favoring the former German colonizers. He was placed in a segregated area in southwestern Rwanda but four years later, the entire family was relocated to the Congo. His father died of pneumonia in 1944. His birth name was Ndahindurwa. He was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church and given the name Jean-Baptiste. He received his primary education at the Groupe Scolaire d'Astrida schools and then higher education at the University of Nyangezi in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. After the removal of his father, King Yuhi V Musinga, his half-brother was crowned King Mutara III Rudahigwa. He helped to secure the Musinga family's return home to Rwanda. After completing his studies, King Kigeli worked for the Belgian colonial administration in the Astrida province in southern Rwanda between 1956 and 1958. He was appointed deputy chief of the Bufundu region in 1959, and was later appointed full chief. King Mutara fell ill after receiving an injection from a Belgian doctor and died on July 25, 1959. Mutara was married but had no children. At his funeral, the hereditary rulers proclaimed Ndahindurwa the new king and he took the name King Kigeli V, at the age of 23. In November of that year, less than a month after his inauguration, the majority Hutu rebelled and killed hundreds of Tutsi, while others were forced to flee to neighboring countries. The Hutus viewed King Kigeli as a representative of the \"oppressive system of colonialists and Tutsis\". Rwanda's last king, Kigeli V, dies King Kigeli V fled to Congo, which had gained independence a few days earlier. He returned briefly the following September when a referendum was being held to decide the fate of the nation. More than 80 percent voted against the monarchy and against King Kigeli, who was then under house arrest. On October 2, 1961, a few days before the general elections and a few months before Rwanda gained its independence, King Kigeli was deported to Tanzania to live in exile. He has not returned to Rwanda since. Rwanda gained independence as a republic, with the Hutu Dominique Mbonyumutwa as president. For the next few years, he lived in exile in several countries. He had been given a house by Idi Amin in Uganda in 1973, but when the dictator was overthrown six years later, he was forced to flee the country and settle in Kenya. In the 1980s, the political situation in Rwanda began to deteriorate and President Juvenal Habyarimana, who had ruled for two decades, was forced to share power with other parties. Exiled Tutsi groups began to attack, and hostilities between the Hutu and Tutsi were revived. President Habyarimana was a friend of Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, and King Kigeli felt unsafe and used his friendship with American Bill Fisher to emigrate to the United States. He settled in Oklahoma in 1992. In a 2007 interview with the BBC, King Kigeli said he wanted to return to his country and rule again. However, he said he would only return if the Rwandans wanted him to return and if they were willing to recognize him as a constitutional monarch. He said he had asked President Kagame and they discussed it. Highlights King Kigeli said President Kagame promised to go and consult his government about it. He still considered himself king because he said he was illegally removed from power. \"The Rwandan people may or may not want me. But before I go home, I need to know if they still want me to be their king,\" he told the BBC. King Kigeli V Ndahindurwa wanted to return to Rwanda An article on the Washingtonian.com website says he lived a life of poverty in exile in the United States. However, King Kigeli told the article: \"They call me the King of Africa.\" He also had a foundation dedicated to helping orphans and vulnerable children from Rwanda. In announcing his death, the king's website said a successor to King Kigeli would be announced soon."}

Breast cancer charities have said the screening scheme gives women a ''better chance'' of treatment if the disease is caught early. 'There is no difference' In the letter to the newspaper, the group of experts said women aged 70-79 who are likely to undergo the screening should seek help if they notice any lumps or symptoms of the disease. ''Many women and doctors are now avoiding the screening because it has no benefit in terms of mortality.'' Breast screening often does more harm than good, a fact that has become internationally known. Claims of saving lives from the screening are balanced by deaths, the doctors said. And cancers that are dangerous and at a high level are not prevented by the screening program, they said.

The errors, listed since 2009, were released last week. 270 women in the UK have died because they missed a repeat screening. 309,000 women who were alive will be sent letters at the end of May asking them to repeat the screening. The NHS estimates that the screening saves one in 200 lives, saving 1,300 lives a year in England. But three in 200 women screened are diagnosed with non-life-threatening cancers, leaving 4,000 women each year receiving inappropriate treatment.

Belgian champions Genk will travel to Austria to face the country's champions Salzburg at the Red Bull Arena tonight. On Sunday, September 8, Samatta was leading Tanzania in a World Cup qualifying group match against Burundi. Although Tanzania won the match on penalties, Samatta suffered a knee injury. Immediately after returning to Belgium, he went for tests and clarified through his Instagram page that he did not suffer any serious injuries although he has been asked to stay off the field for a while. However, he did not specify how long he will be out of the field. Last Friday, KRC Genk took to the field against Charleroi in the Belgian league. Samatta, who is Genk's main striker, did not play in the game and was not on the bench. Genk lost the game 2-1. However, there is encouraging news that Samatta is already training, and two days ago he posted a video on his Instagram page climbing a hill at speed.

Sudan has been in turmoil since the military ousted President Omar al-Bashir in April. Protracted talks on the agreement have been ongoing amid ongoing violence. The long-awaited peace agreement has sparked celebrations in Sudan, which has been in the throes of a months-long conflict. Protests erupted in December after Bashir's government declared a state of emergency to impose economic rescue measures. He was ousted by the military in April after long-running protests outside the defense ministry in Khartoum. The protests have been calling for a transfer of power to civilians. What does the agreement say? A document outlining the terms of the three-year transition period was agreed last month by the military council and opposition leaders. The power-sharing agreement called for a government of six civilians and five generals. \"I declare to the Sudanese, Africans and the international community that the two sides have reached a comprehensive agreement on the constitutional resolution,\" Lebatt told reporters on Saturday. He added that further meetings would be held to work out the technicalities of the signing ceremony, but did not provide details of the agreement itself. A draft resolution seen by Reuters said the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which have been accused of killing protesters, would now be placed under general military control, and intelligence services would be overseen by the ruling council and the cabinet as a whole. The agreement on the resolution comes after the military council announced that RSF soldiers had been dismissed and arrested in connection with the killing of protesters, including four schoolchildren killed this week. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which have been accused of killing protesters, will now be placed under general military rule. The killings sparked widespread protests across the country and delayed talks. What do we know about the transition period? The long transition period is seen as a victory for the pro-democracy movement - the generals had threatened to call snap elections after the June 3 coup.

Regarding the warning issued by the US Embassy in Tanzania, Mr. Sirro said: \"That is information like any other information, it can be true or false, but we as security agencies do not ignore it.\" He added that they received information about the threat since Tuesday, June 17, 2019, and that their operations and intelligence teams and others are working on it. In its announcement, the US Embassy in Tanzania has issued a warning that there are rumors of attacks planned in Dar es Salaam. According to the warning published on the official social media pages of the Embassy, ​​the Masaki area is the target. The area located on the Msasani Peninsula is one of the most luxurious residential areas in the city.

What does the Tanzania terror attack warning mean? 1998 Attacks Commemoration More than 20 years ago, jihadists attacked the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and since then, terrorism has continued to take root in East Africa. It was August 7, 1998, at 4:30 am, when two assailants detonated a truck loaded with explosives in front of the US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. Nine minutes later, another bomb exploded at the US embassy in Dar es Salaam, in neighboring Tanzania. At least 242 people were killed in the two attacks, which completely destroyed the US embassies and caused nearby buildings to collapse. The attacks were unexpected, not only for Kenyans and Tanzanians but for the entire world. Never before had such a large number of victims been witnessed in an attack carried out by the then-unknown Al Qaeda terrorist network. Initially, attacks by Islamic militants were mostly carried out on military installations. But suddenly Osama Bin Laden and his group gained international notoriety for their evil deeds. Some experts say their attacks marked the beginning of the war on terror, following which the United States responded by launching missiles against targets in various countries."}

The number of people who died from the accident on August 10, 2019 in Morogoro has reached 104. This death toll was due to the injured admitted to Muhimbili National Hospital continuing to pass away. 62 people were confirmed dead on the day of the tragedy and more than 70 were injured, and since then the number of deaths has been increasing gradually until today, September 1, 2019. What happened in Morogoro? Earlier last week, the BBC reported that 13 of the victims of the accident who are still at the Muhimbili National Hospital are expected to undergo surgery to repair their structures and limbs. Muhimbili National Hospital Surgeon Edwin Mrema explained that the surgery could take two to three weeks depending on the extent of the injury. \"The skin is dead so it has to come off with medication and every day we clean it thoroughly. Two to three weeks, it depends on the thickness of the burn or how deep the fire has gone?\" According to Muhimbili's Director of Information, Aminiel Aligaesha, out of the 13 injured, 11 now remain after one died on August 31 and another on the 28th. Most of the injured admitted to Muhimbili had suffered 80 percent or more burns.
