{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content in one sentence..Will it become more difficult to put Russian businessmen in pretrial detention?\nThe law already limits the rules for keeping businessmen in pretrial detention, but most often it is not implemented. The draft law was approved by the court plenary session and sent to the State Duma, the court's press service representative Valeria Kosovich told the BBC Russian Service.The document has not yet been registered in the Duma database of draft laws..The bill (available to the BBC) amends the Russian Criminal Procedure Code (CPC).The courts and investigators may face additional restrictions when they decide whether to send an entrepreneur to a pretrial detention facility at the pre-trial stage..If the bill is passed, in order to extend detention, investigators will have to indicate what actions they intend to take in the near future, as well as the reasons why they did not do so earlier..When making a decision, the judge will have to assess the effectiveness of the actions of the preliminary investigation bodies, take into account the complexity of the criminal case and the timeliness of the investigative actions..The new procedure for making decisions on detention will apply to articles on fraud (including large-scale and especially large-scale fraud), embezzlement and misappropriation, and illegal entrepreneurship..These articles include, for example, illegal gambling, production and circulation of alcohol, banking activities, money laundering, illegal obtaining of credit and restriction of competition..Vyacheslav Lebedev has recently become concerned about the humanization of criminal legislation. In the event of a refusal to extend the period of detention, the judge chooses a preventive measure in the form of bail or house arrest..All this, as now, will not apply to cases where the suspect or accused does not live in Russia permanently, if he was hiding from the investigation or violated a preventive measure..99% in custody Taking into custody is the most popular preventive measure in Russian courts.Courts refuse to extend the period of detention in less than 1% of the total number of cases, Ivan Sustin, managing partner of Business Support Group, told the BBC Russian Service.While a businessman sits in a pretrial detention center at the investigation stage, and his property is seized, he often loses his business, lawyers and advocates noted.The amendments to the law, if adopted, will help avoid a situation where a defendant spends months or even years in a pretrial detention facility, while the investigation into his case is slow or not conducted at all, the explanatory note to the bill says..\"The extension of a preventive measure in the form of detention most often occurs automatically.In justifying such a need, the investigator points to a significant volume of planned investigative actions, and the courts rarely check whether the investigator has carried out these actions,” lawyer Anton Pulyayev told the BBC.\"Currently, the extension of the preventive measure for defendants held in custody, including those under economic articles, is more of a ritualistic event,\" Sustin agrees..- The main thing for the investigator is not to forget who of the accused is in custody and where, and not to miss the deadline after which the person will be released.But it is important for the court that formalities are observed and that the accused does not have an illness that prevents detention..And even then, not always.\".The Russian Criminal Code already included a special procedure for detention for \"crimes in the sphere of economic activity\".However, in practice this did not work, Pulyayev points out: law enforcement officers are opening a new case in addition to the “entrepreneurial” one..In November 2016, the Supreme Court of Russia already explained how to deal with businessmen's cases.It stated that the court should not abuse the property rights and freedoms of entrepreneurs..\"In the new bill, the Supreme Court is developing the logic of prohibitions,\" says Yana Yakovleva, head of the Business Solidarity organization..- There is one interesting point that was not there before - when filing a petition to extend the arrest, the judge will be required to assess how fair these wishes of the investigator are.And the bill even explains to the judge how exactly to evaluate\".In the Anglo-Saxon judicial system, when making a decision, the judge is guided by the general characteristics of the accused, his personal qualities and proceeds from the fact that the investigators may be wrong, Yakovleva explained.At the court hearing, it is decided whether the accused has motives to hide from the investigation.In the Russian system, judges simply confirm the opinion of the investigation, Yakovleva is sure.Business ombudsman Boris Titov (left) constantly appeals to the state (right - Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika) with requests not to \"harass\" business If amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code are adopted, the investigator will think carefully before petitioning the court to detain an entrepreneur, believes Alexander Baryaev, advisor to the chairman of the Yakovlev and Partners Bar Association.Otherwise, the investigator may be charged with abuse of power..Long discussion In August, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a solution to reduce the number of entrepreneurs in pretrial detention.The issue of keeping businessmen in custody has been discussed for several years.In 2016, Supreme Court Chairman Vyacheslav Lebedev said that Russian courts do not always correctly interpret the law when considering cases of entrepreneurs.The arrest of businessmen often occurs for formal reasons, he noted..Business ombudsman Boris Titov said that criminal prosecution is often used as pressure on business structures.And in the same 2016, Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika stated that security forces should bear criminal responsibility for the illegal detention, arrest or prosecution of entrepreneurs..\"Hundreds of businessmen have been rehabilitated at the pre-trial stage and in court,\" he noted..As a result, the punishment for such crimes has indeed become tougher: in December of last year, amendments were adopted according to which law enforcement officers can receive from five to ten years in prison for illegally initiating a criminal case to obstruct business, or out of selfish or other personal interest..This refers to situations where their actions resulted in the cessation of business activities or major damage.."}

There have even been reports from social media users located near the demarcation line about the alleged use of \"Grad\" rockets by separatists, which has not happened for a long time.The unrecognized \"DPR\" and \"LPR\" also report numerous ceasefire violations, but blame the Ukrainian army for them..Does this mean the end of the \"school truce\" in Donbas? BBC Ukraine asked representatives of the ATO press center and military experts about this.The ceasefire has not been cancelled \"The ceasefire began on August 25 and continues to this day.We are recording individual violations, but overall the ceasefire is working and no one has cancelled it,\" ATO headquarters spokesman Anatoly Stelmakh told BBC Ukraine.\"Despite the shelling, we are recording positive dynamics, because the enemy very rarely uses heavy weapons and mortars.If you compare the number of attacks before the ceasefire, it differs significantly,” he added..Anatoly Stelmakh also denied the use of Grads by illegal armed groups.Moreover, according to him, during the ceasefire, even the so-called \"portable Grads\" - Partizan rocket launchers - were not used..\"Grad-Partizan\" fires single charges, was developed for use by infantry (photo - August 2016) Military expert Mikhail Zhirokhov commented on the report of the use of rocket artillery as follows: \"I also read the report about \"Grads\", but there was a coincidence - on that day in Donetsk there was rain with thunder and thunderclaps were mistaken for shelling from \"Grad\".The ceasefire has also been denied by military observer and volunteer Serge Marco, who maintains contacts with the Marines in the Primorsky direction..\"The situation has not worsened, it has been worse during this time.“It’s just that for some reason the artillery has started to come into play,” he told BBC Ukraine.However, even under truce conditions, there will be losses.According to official data, combat losses of ATO forces for the period from August 25 to September 15 amounted to three killed and 20 wounded..Another soldier died from wounds received before the ceasefire.The shelling has decreased, but it has not stopped. The ATO headquarters says that the shelling is mainly carried out with small arms, 82-mm mortars and grenade launchers..However, there are cases when the enemy uses heavy 120 mm mortars, as well as tanks and infantry fighting vehicles..The main military operations were concentrated in the Donetsk and Primorsky directions..The Luhansk region had been quiet for almost a week, but shelling resumed on Friday.\"25-30 shellings per day on a 400-kilometer front is not enough.Before the truce there were up to 100,\" notes Mikhail Zhirokhov..According to him, the main losses of the ATO forces are caused by sniper fire and explosions on trip wires in the frontline zone..And the last irretrievable loss, as Anatoly Stelmakh said, occurred on Friday as a result of a grenade launcher attack in the area of ​​the Butovka mine..Serge Marco notes that there is no reason to talk about a significant exacerbation in the autumn.\"Fictitious commitment\" The \"DPR\" and \"LPR\" accuse the ATO forces of violating the ceasefire The self-proclaimed \"DPR\" and \"LPR\" traditionally accuse the ATO forces of violating the ceasefire.They claim that in recent days the number of attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces has varied from 30 to 50..In particular, the press service of the \"DPR Armed Forces\" stated that Ukrainian servicemen used 122-mm artillery, heavy mortars, grenade launchers and small arms..There are also reports of shelling from tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers..The main fire activity, the \"DPR Armed Forces\" add, is concentrated on the western outskirts of Donetsk and Yasinovataya.And near Shyrokyne, Peski and Maryinka, the \"DPR\" notes, several sniper groups of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are working, which is why the illegal armed groups suffered losses there..The ATO headquarters denies such data and insists that the ATO forces are only opening return fire..Without \"humanitarian convoys\"? Since August 2014, Russia has sent almost 70 \"humanitarian convoys\" to Donbass. Meanwhile, information has appeared in the Russian media that Russia has decided to refuse \"humanitarian support\" to the self-proclaimed republics.Thus, the publication \"RBK\" claims that at a government meeting the Russian Ministry of Finance was instructed \"to exclude from the draft federal budget for 2018 and for the planning period of 2019 and 2020 in full the costs of providing humanitarian support to individual territories in 2019-2020.\".By separate territories, Russian journalists claim, they mean the \"DPR\" and \"LPR\", and the funds that can be saved in this way will allegedly go to the development of Crimea and the Kaliningrad region.However, there was no official confirmation of the veracity of this data..The last Russian \"humanitarian convoy\" arrived in Donbass on August 24.Humanitarian aid has been provided to residents of Donbass since August 2014.This was the sixty-eighth column, and, as the Russian Emergencies Ministry claims, it brought about 750 tons of humanitarian aid: \"children's food packages, medicines, medical supplies, educational literature to prepare for the new school year.\".Earlier, official Kyiv repeatedly accused Russian \"humanitarian convoys\" that entered through sections of the border not controlled by Ukraine of delivering weapons and ammunition to separatists..\"Sometimes after the arrival of humanitarian convoys we recorded an increase in shelling of our positions.But that was quite a long time ago,\" ATO headquarters spokesman Anatoliy Stelmakh told BBC Ukraine.The Kremlin denies such accusations.There was no significant escalation after the arrival of the last humanitarian convoy - on the contrary, on August 25, the same \"school truce\" came into force.."}

37% compared to 62%..\"Golden Hundred\" in British style In Britain, they delved even deeper into history and tried to track data for almost a century - since 1918.Professor Danny Dorling of the University of Sheffield found that for 50 years after the end of the First World War, the incomes of the richest 1% of Britons fell, but then growth resumed, and in recent years the stratification of British society has been particularly rapid.According to Professor Dorling's calculations, in 2010 alone the wealth of the richest 1% of Britain's population increased by 20%, and in the crisis year of 2009 – by 25%.Occupy Wall Street protesters believe the rich 1% are making their income at the expense of the remaining 99% After the increase, the average salary of a top manager at one of Britain's top 100 companies was £4.2 million a year.The average salary of their subordinates in the same companies was 145 times less, and the average salary in Britain as a whole was 162 times less than the salaries of the \"golden hundred\" managers..The theory of advanced capitalism… The authors of the documentary series \"The Wealth Gap\", created by the BBC, calculated that in 1997, 90% of the population of Britain had an average income of 10.5 thousand pounds, while the income of the richest 1% exceeded this amount by 18 times.Only 10 years later, in 2007, the average income of 90% of the population increased to 12.5 thousand pounds a year, but the income of the richest 1% increased 95 times and amounted to an average of about 1 million pounds a year..In classical political economy, it is believed that the income of the richest 20% of the population in a country should not exceed the income of the poorest 20% by more than 10 times..In the US, which has always been an example of \"wild capitalism\", this figure is now 9 - that is how many times the profits of the richest exceed the profits of the poorest..In Sweden, which has long embraced a model of capitalism with a \"human face\" called \"Swedish socialism,\" the ratio is 3.5 to 1..… and the practice of the era of capital accumulation Luxury cars and beggars in Ukraine - always close by The authors of a 2011 study conducted by the State Statistics Committee of Russia concluded that wealth inequality in five former Soviet republics, including Ukraine, is a potential driver of political instability.There are no official statistics regarding wealth inequality in Ukraine, but experts now say that the difference between the incomes of the richest and poorest in Ukraine is at least 40 times.Recently, these assessments were also referred to by a deputy from the ruling Party of Regions, former Prime Minister Anatoliy Kinakh, who claims that the situation in Ukraine is worsening due to a phenomenon that he called \"conspicuous consumption.\".Publishing its annual ranking of the richest Ukrainians, \"The Golden Hundred,\" the magazine \"Korrespondent\" noted that the concentration of capital in Ukraine exceeds the figures for neighboring oil- and gas-rich Russia, known for its billionaires..According to the magazine's calculations, the total assets of the 100 richest Ukrainians make up 61% of the country's annual GDP, while the hundred richest Russians own only a third of Russia's GDP..\"The average salary in Ukraine is $280.This means that a person with such an income needs to work for more than 13 thousand years to get into the Golden Hundred..And in order to top the rating, it would have to endure 7.6 million years, whereas two years ago 3.5 million years would have been enough,” writes Korrespondent..Almost the only international rating in which Ukraine is still among developed countries due to its high general level of education is the Human Development Index, which is calculated by the UN.In 2011, Ukraine ranked 76th among 187 countries in the world.But if Ukraine has a high 21st place in terms of education, then in terms of population income it is only 100th, and in terms of life expectancy it is 123rd..UN experts also specifically noted that if human development indicators were adjusted for wealth inequality, the country's index would fall by 9.2%, which would also affect Ukraine's place in the overall ranking..Overall, according to UN methodology, four out of five Ukrainians are poor, surviving on less than $14 a day, which is considered the poverty line in developed countries..However, the expanded definition of poverty, which the UN measures not only by income level, but also by access to normal housing, education and medicine, can be fully applied to Ukraine.."}

And will its signal be stronger in remote areas? What is 5G? This is a new generation of mobile internet, which should provide significantly faster data transfer to and from the phone, wider coverage and more stable communication.This is about improved use of the radio spectrum and the possibility of simultaneous access to the mobile Internet for more devices..What will it give? \"Everything we do with our smartphones now, we will be able to do faster and better,\" explains Ian Fogg of analytics company OpenSignal.\"Imagine smart glasses with augmented reality, mobile virtual reality, much higher quality video, internet-connected things that will make our cities smarter,\" he adds..\"But the most exciting thing is all those new services that will certainly appear, but which we cannot yet predict,\" promises Ian Fogg..Driverless cars will be able to communicate with each other and with road services Imagine entire swarms of drones that will work together to conduct search and rescue missions, prevent the spread of fires or monitor traffic - in constant communication via 5G networks with each other and with bases on the ground.5G is also expected to be critical for autonomous vehicles to communicate with each other and monitor traffic conditions..Gamers on mobile devices will also feel the speed increase, mobile video will load instantly and without \"glitches\", and video calls will become higher quality and more reliable.Eventually, a variety of fitness devices worn during exercise or physical activity will be able to monitor the physical condition of their wearers in real time and contact doctors in case of emergencies or health threats..How does it work? Several new technologies are expected to be introduced at once, but full standards for all 5G protocols have not yet been developed.Higher frequency bands provide greater functionality, but the shorter wavelength means that the signal's range is weaker and is more easily blocked by physical objects in its path..Therefore, the number of network transmitters may increase significantly..However, such a solution is expensive, and not all telecommunications companies are ready to implement it..Will 5G be so different from 4G? Yes, it is a new radio technology, but at first it may not be felt so much, because network operators will use it to enhance the effect of 4G Internet - so that the transition of users to 5G is gradual.Therefore, the speed of the Internet will depend on what equipment the network operator will use, as well as on the installation of new antennas and transmitters..How fast can 5G be? The fastest mobile networks today, 4G, offer average speeds of 45 megabits per second.Telecom equipment maker Qualcomm believes that 5G will deliver 10-20 times faster internet speeds - and that's under normal conditions, not in lab tests..That is, it will take about a minute to download a movie in good quality..However, this applies to 5G networks built on the basis of current 4G networks..And some dedicated 5G networks will be able to easily reach standard speeds of over 1 gigabit per second..But all this seems to be possible only a few years after the introduction of 5G..Why does the world need 5G? With the increasing number of smartphones in the world, we download more and more data every year - the popularity of video and music is growing very quickly.The existing frequency resource is overloaded, which leads to communication problems..Especially when there are many people nearby trying to access the internet at the same time.5G will be much better at handling the situation when thousands of devices are connected to the network - from smartphones to equipment sensors, from video cameras to smart street lights..When will it happen? It's unlikely that most countries will launch 5G before 2020, but Qatar-based Ooredoo says it has already launched a commercial 5G network.South Korea plans to do this next year: three major networks have agreed to launch simultaneously.China also plans to launch 5G in 2019.Will there be a new phone? Smartphones need new chips for 5G I'm afraid so.But when 4G was introduced in 2009-2010, smartphones for the network appeared before the infrastructure was fully operational..Which was a bit of a disappointment for customers who had paid in advance for something that didn't quite work..This time, according to Ian Fogg of analytics company OpenSignal, manufacturers are unlikely to make the same mistake..The phones will only appear when the new networks are fully operational, possibly at the end of 2019..These next-generation phones will be able to seamlessly switch between 4G and 5G networks for more stable connectivity..Will this be the end of landline communications? The short answer is no..Telecom companies have invested too much in fibre and copper fixed lines to give up so easily..Home and office broadband will remain for many years to come.No matter how good wireless connection is, many people prefer stable and reliable wires..5G could become a kind of additional service in our communication with the outside world.It will also facilitate the \"Internet of Things\" - a global network of Internet-connected physical devices equipped with sensors, detectors and information-transmitting devices..Will it work in rural areas? It's unlikely to make much difference to remote areas In the UK and many other countries, there are frequent complaints about lack of signal and slow speeds in rural areas.But 5G won't necessarily solve this problem, since 5G will operate on high-frequency bands, at least at first..These bands have high power but cover short distances..5G will primarily become a connection for densely populated areas.Low-frequency bands (typically 600-800 MHz) perform better over longer distances, so network operators are focusing on improving 4G LTE coverage in parallel with the rollout of 5G..But the reality is that for some people in very remote areas, the connection will still be poor..In Ukraine, 4G connection is available only in a few dozen populated areas.Follow our news on Twitter and Telegram"}

Scientists study the depths of space using electromagnetic waves.They can be measured and some calculations can be made based on these measurements, but no radiation can illuminate the all-consuming absolute blackness..Moreover, when crossing the event horizon - the imaginary boundary beyond which measurements become impossible - time and space effectively merge..The return journey is only possible if you turn back time..However, scientists have found a way to do this..After all, if a black hole has a gigantic mass, then stars should revolve around it..This means that the movement of these stars can be used to fairly accurately calculate the location and mass of the invisible object itself..This is exactly what two groups of scientists did independently: one was led by Reinhard Genzel, the other by Andrea Ghez..They pointed telescopes toward the center of our galaxy and began to observe a group of stars located there, the movement of which could indicate the presence of a black hole nearby..The center of the Milky Way is hidden in a cloud of interstellar dust, so observations had to be made in the infrared spectrum, but the conclusions of both groups coincided, confirming each other..The trajectory of at least six stars is actually influenced by a nearby object..An invisible, yet incredibly massive celestial body.The only possible explanation for this phenomenon is that there, at a distance of about 26 thousand light years, is a supermassive black hole, approximately 4 million times heavier than the Sun..The closest star to it makes a complete revolution around the invisible one in about 16 Earth years..And the distance between them is \"only\" 17 light hours..For comparison, sunlight takes just over eight minutes to reach Earth.."}

The 48-second video was shot by scientist Vinay Kumar from the Wildlife Conservation Society back in April 2016. Kumar told the BBC he had not released the footage until now because he \"didn't realise its significance\". \"This is the first known footage of such behaviour from a wild elephant and has left scientists baffled,\" the Wildlife Conservation Society said in a statement. What was the elephant doing? According to Kumar, WCS researchers had been in the forest early that day to check their tiger surveillance cameras. About 50 metres away, Kumar spotted the elephant with smoke coming out of her mouth and started filming her. \"It looked like she was smoking - she was bringing her trunk to her mouth and then blowing out a cloud of smoke,\" Kumar said. Biologist Varun Goswami, who studied the video, believes that the elephant most likely ate burnt wood - ate charcoal, and got rid of the ash, which also got into her trunk, in this unusual way. \"Charcoal has well-known toxin-detoxifying properties, and although it does not contain many nutrients, it may attract wild animals due to its medicinal value,\" the scientist explained. \"In addition, charcoal can serve as a laxative, which may also be useful for animals that consume it after forest fires, lightning strikes or grass burning,\" Goswami added.

According to art historians, this particular self-portrait of the Dutchman dates back to the period when he suffered from psychosis.The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam has officially established that the portrait was painted by the post-impressionist himself.The painting was painted in the late summer of 1889 in a mental hospital in Saint-Remy-de-Provence..Doubts about the authorship of the portrait began to arise in 1970..The National Gallery in Oslo, which owns the painting, sent it from Norway to the Netherlands for examination..The study used X-rays and involved experts in Van Gogh's smear technique..Van Gogh's letters to his brother Theo were analyzed.Van Gogh painted more than 30 self-portraits. In September 1889, Vincent wrote to Theo that he had tried to paint when he was ill..He describes a \"serious attack of psychosis\" that lasted for a month and a half, beginning in July; and although by the end of this period he felt he could write again, the sense of anxiety remained..The Norwegian museum acquired the portrait in 1910 from a Parisian collector: it was the first of Van Gogh's self-portraits to be acquired for public display..\"This self-portrait has been in doubt for a very long time,\" Louis van Tilborgh, a senior specialist at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, told AFP..\"Everything in this work seemed to point to Van Gogh's brush, but at the same time some details were different from his other paintings..We had to find an explanation for this, and it was difficult, but we seem to have solved the mystery,\" Tilborgh said..This is a portrait of a man who clearly has a mental illness, says Tilborgh..In the Amsterdam Van Gogh Museum this portrait is presented as \"Self-portrait of a sick man.\" At first glance, the canvas looks like a typical work by Van Gogh..But the use of darker colours than in his other works of the same period looks suspicious to connoisseurs: blues and yellows are muted, and overall some details appear unrefined..Oslo Museum curator of old masters and contemporary art Mai Britt Gulen said the gallery had been open to any outcome but was still very pleased the painting was genuine..A year before this portrait was created, a famous incident occurred: Van Gogh cut off part of his ear after a quarrel with his friend and colleague Paul Gauguin..From that day on, Van Gogh began a long period of moving from one hospital to another..\"Even though Van Gogh was terrified to admit that his condition was as bad as that of the other patients in the asylum, he may have painted this portrait to come to terms with what he saw in the mirror: a person he didn't want to be with, but was,\" says Van Tilborgh, who in addition to his work at the museum also teaches art history at the University of Amsterdam..\"This is what makes this painting so remarkable and even therapeutic..This is the only work about which it is known for certain that Van Gogh painted it in a state of psychosis.\".The painting is currently on display at the Amsterdam Museum; it will return to Oslo in 2021, for the opening of the new National Museum building..Malevich or a fake?

The publication suggests that the events around Crimea are preparations for full-scale military action..However, according to Vladimir Fesenko, if Vladimir Putin wanted war, we would have already seen it.And Vadim Karasev adds that the Kremlin is not interested in a big war.Another version is an attempt by the Russian Federation to justify the rapid militarization of annexed Crimea, as stated by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense.\"Statements about Ukrainian saboteurs are nothing more than an attempt to distract the attention of the local population and the world community from criminal actions to transform the peninsula into an isolated military base,\" the ministry believes..The publication suggests that the Russians' statements can also be viewed as a technological move to consolidate the electorate before the elections to the Russian State Duma in September..\"KP in Ukraine\" also attracted representatives from various regions to discuss the situation, asking the question: \"What are you preparing for?\" \"We should have been prepared for such actions from Russia a long time ago.I don't believe a single word the Russian president says about the events in Crimea.It's a cunning plan that gives the neighbor free rein.But it is unlikely that Russia will openly attack us,\" says engineer Roman Petsukh from Lviv..\"I think this whole story is a provocation to further inflame hatred towards Ukraine on the part of Crimeans..I do not rule out that a new stage of escalation of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is possible,\" says manager Anatoly Derevyanko from Dnepr.\"A lot will become clear in the coming days.If nothing else big happens, the situation will normalize,\" says scientist Gennady Krivonosov from Kramatorsk.\"There is always hope for a peaceful resolution.But in our case we are dealing with a dark horse, so there is no way to look the enemy in the face and determine the degree of danger,\" says political strategist Anatoly Volovets from Odessa..\"Fabricated\" incident The newspaper \"Den\" also asked experts what to expect from the Kremlin and what Ukraine can do.According to Roland Freudenstein, deputy director of the Martens Centre in Brussels, he sees no logical reason why Ukraine should organise terrorism in Crimea with the expected consequences that would give Russia a reason to \"react\"..\"For me and most people in the West, it is absolutely clear that the incident was fabricated by a professional from the FSB.What happens next? In the worst case, Russia will take this as an excuse to attack north of Crimea, either to seize some territory, or at least to carry out some \"punitive raids\".Artillery and air strikes on Ukrainian targets are also possible,\" the expert believes..According to Defense Ministry spokesman Sergei Glushko, the fact is that the Russians have several scenarios for a direct and large-scale attack on Ukraine.\"Another question is when they can implement them, because they need favorable conditions inside Ukraine,\" the expert adds..And Maxim Rozumny, director of the Center for Research on Russian Problems, sees the root of the problem in the Normandy format.He recalls that Ukraine initiated the meeting at the G-20 forum in China.\"This is not the most pleasant conversation for Putin; he has other priorities during his visit to China,\" the expert explains..Donbass is concerned \"Segodnya\" reports that the events in Crimea have seriously alarmed residents of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions not controlled by Ukraine.People are afraid of an escalation of the military conflict, especially since a lot of military equipment has appeared in cities recently.\"During the day, covered Urals drive everywhere in Donetsk, and at night I often wake up from the roar of the equipment,\" says Donetsk resident Sergey Bystryakov.The newspaper notes that checks of citizens have been stepped up in the republics.\"In Zaitsevo at the \"DPR\" checkpoint they are checking everyone's phones - they are looking for saboteurs.They have been searching for two years now and have not found a single one yet,” says local resident Viktor Golovachev..Local residents also claim that petrol has disappeared from gas stations in Donetsk, and they attribute this to the accumulation of resources to escalate the military conflict..According to military expert Dmitry Tymchuk, terrorist attacks on Crimean territory are beneficial to Russia, not Ukraine, and events on the peninsula could have long-term consequences.It is possible that this could lead to an escalation of the conflict in Donbass, he believes..\"From a sick head to a healthy one\" \"Ukraina Moloda\" publishes a selection of materials on the situation in Crimea under the title \"From a sick head to a healthy one\".According to one version, Russia may begin aggression against Ukraine in the near future.

The decree also deprives the courts of the right to dissolve the constitutional assembly, which is writing a new constitution. The 100 members of the assembly were given an additional two months to draft a new basic law that should replace the constitution that was repealed after the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak.

Sadiq Khan said bold action was needed to tackle childhood obesity. Fast food adverts at a bus stop \"Reducing exposure to junk food adverts makes a difference - not just for children, but also for the parents, families and carers who buy and cook for their children,\" the Mayor of London said.

I'm not sure I've ever really reacted to anything..I have always been focused on the children, and that was the case this time too..When Katherine found out she was pregnant, she told her rapist… I told her I was pregnant and that it was his baby, expecting him to say, \"No, it's not mine,\" not expecting him to acknowledge the fact.He never acknowledged the circumstances in which the conception occurred, but he never denied that the child was his..I didn't consider abortion..I am not against abortion at all; I think it is a matter of personal choice..But I personally felt that the act of killing the child would make the situation even worse, and that it would be harder for me to live with than any difficulties that would arise in connection with the birth of an unplanned child, especially when there are already two.Actually, it's a bit of a selfish approach because I didn't think about what this child's life would be like..I didn't think it would be immoral to get rid of the child..I thought that it would be worse for me, that it would be harder for me to cope not only with the rape, but then also with the abortion, than to simply step over the rape and give birth to a child..I had no one close to me.The women on the playground were very judgmental when they realized I was pregnant because they knew I was a single mother, but I didn't explain how or why I got pregnant..I noticed that people started looking at me and I knew that they were talking about me behind my back..My friend who lived next door had kids who went to the same school as me and she heard things there and it was hard because I didn't want to say I was raped.The only option left was a one-night stand or something like that, which I also didn't want to be associated with, but it was the better of two evils.It was easier that way, if you like, to let people believe in what they wanted..And also, I didn't want the child to be treated specially in advance, because I didn't want him to have this label..And if people knew, it could potentially affect how they interacted with him..I think the fact that I wanted to protect my son from the very first minute helped me cope with all this..And if it were any other way, then it would be unbearable, because he is the only good thing I could get out of this whole situation..The first time I held him, the most striking thing was - and this still remains the biggest problem for me - that his eyes were exactly like his father's..And when I first saw his eyes, it was the only time I truly felt horror and realized what had happened..As he grew, those eyes of his became even more [like his father's].And the eyes are one of the few things I remember about being raped, which I think is pretty common..He has very bright eyes, they both do..They are very expressive..I honestly don't think the way he was conceived affected my attachment to him, certainly not on a conscious level..The only thing I have to remind myself is when I make eye contact with him or see him make a gesture (because some mannerisms can be inherited) that it has nothing to do with his father..If I suddenly have a flashback, it is simply a physical reaction associated with a specific memory of what happened..I loved him from the moment he was born..He doesn't really ask about his father..This question arose - and this was a problem - when at school they did work on the topic \"My Family\" and he was asked to bring photos of his dad, but of course I couldn't do that..That's when I had to explain something to him..It's only in the last few years that I've told some people [about what happened].I didn't talk about it at all for a very long time..And only to those people whom I know and who already have a relationship with my son, so this news will not affect them..Katherine says she never regretted keeping the baby… It's not easy anyway.If you give up a child for adoption, it will affect your entire life..If you get pregnant and have an abortion, that will also leave a mark..But if you decide to have a child, your life will change too..There will always be some damage, irreparable damage, final, and how to reduce it? So it's about you, but it's also about the child.It would be wrong if I gave birth to him and then couldn’t cope, couldn’t give him the love, care, or closeness that he needs so much..That would also be very bad..It can be very lonely at times, it can be very difficult at times, but the most important thing I think is this: the rape hurt me, but something good came out of it - my son..And I also think that no matter which of these three options I choose, I will still feel lonely sometimes, but at least I have something wonderful out of all this.But of course, this does not mean that this approach will suit everyone..Catherine's name has been changed to protect her privacy Illustrations by Katie Horwich."}

Mund specifically named several names that she believes are responsible for the bullying..In particular, she believes that her interests were infringed upon by the chair of the Miss America pageant, Gretchen Carlson, and the executive director, Regina Hopper..“I will say frankly: I am absolutely sure that the current leadership [of the competition] does not hear me and does not want to hear me; just as they do not want to know who I am and what I think about the position and possibilities of this organization in the future,” Mund writes in her address..\"Our chairman and CEO have systematically silenced me, sidelined me, marginalized me, and basically continually undermined my role as Miss America in a variety of ways, both obvious and more subtle.\".In her lengthy letter, Kara Mund explains in detail how exactly this happened..For example, according to her, the competition management did not allow her to publish any messages on social networks as the holder of the title \"Miss America\", and also repeatedly criticized her appearance..Gretchen Carlson won the Miss America pageant in 1989. She writes that she was treated in a condescending manner that suggested she \"didn't understand the responsibility of the role\" and how and why the Miss America pageant is important..Kara Mund, 24, who represented North Dakota in the 2017 pageant, wrote that she carefully studied the laws of New Jersey, where the pageant is based, and concluded that the management's behavior amounted to workplace bullying..\"My contract states - and I am regularly reminded of this both in words and in deeds - that I can be fired at any time, even without special cause,\" Mund writes..Just revenge? Mund believes that the behavior of the pageant's management is retaliation for her interview with the Press of Atlantic City, in which she hinted at squabbles within the organization's ranks..She said the year since her victory had been difficult and expressed fears that \"she will be punished\" for her candor..Her recorded televised address was then cut to 30 seconds and she was also told not to wear the dress she had chosen for herself for the traditional beauty parade, despite the fact that the outfit had been approved in advance..In response to the beauty queen's letter, the Miss America Organization released a statement expressing support for Kara Mund and regretting that \"she chose to air her grievances publicly rather than privately.\".\"Her letter contains a false interpretation of events and various unfounded accusations.We are trying to contact her privately to address her concerns,\" the organization said in a statement..\"I never intended - or wanted - to be a whistleblower,\" Mund wrote in her letter, concluding: \"The Miss America pageant is in a very vulnerable position right now..To survive, he needs our support.\".Miss America 2015 Swimsuit Show A Crisis in a Star Franchise?

Well, if they make them, we will do everything so that people are not offended,\" Voskresensky said..And in the Voronezh region, acting governor Alexander Gusev honestly admitted that he is “not yet ready to formulate his opinion regarding pension provision.”.Authorities in 24 Russian regions chose not to comment on the matter.These include Primorye, Tatarstan, Sevastopol, Tver Oblast, and the republics of the North Caucasus..Putin's rating is only half the problem The decline in Putin's rating and support is \"only half the problem\", two sources close to the presidential administration, who are not authorized to comment to the media on this issue, tell the BBC.The problem is that on September 9, a single voting day, many federal, regional and local elections will take place..Direct elections of governors will be held in 22 Russian regions, and local deputies will elect governors in four more.In addition, 16 regions will hold elections for regional parliament deputies, four will elect mayors, and 12 will hold elections for city council deputies..In addition to this already impressive list, by-elections for State Duma deputies in single-mandate constituencies will be held in seven more regions.Governors, regional parliament deputies and local council members are disappointed with the government's decision to announce the preparation of a law on raising the retirement age several months before the single voting day.\"This should have been done several years ago to prepare public opinion.Now we have serious problems..And the federal government pushed all this onto the regions so that we could talk to the people..\"They themselves are afraid,\" one regional leader, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of losing his job, told the BBC..Most governors - even those facing elections - will have to support the reform, says political scientist Andrei Kolyadin.In extreme cases, they will be allowed not to talk about it from high platforms, the expert explains.Although, according to Kolyadin, the main problems from the pension reform will be felt after the gubernatorial elections, and this is unlikely to affect the results of the vote itself.But in the elections to regional parliaments, United Russia will have a harder time, he believes..\"If she supports the reform, she will lose voters.“And she has no option not to support the reform,” says Kolyadin..Regions are in no hurry Regional authorities must send their opinion on the bill to the State Duma by July 17.However, regional parliaments are in no hurry to send feedback.About 20 regions sent positive feedback 10 days before the deadline, according to the websites of regional parliaments.Another 19 regional parliaments have held preliminary discussions but have not yet reached conclusions..The Moscow City Duma also did not express its opinion on raising the retirement age - the chairman of the commission on social policy, Mikhail Antontsev, referred to the fact that regional parliaments are not obliged to give feedback on all federal bills: \"This is not an issue that needs to be resolved urgently.\".Only eight regional responses to the bill have been published on the State Duma website so far..Of these, four are with a proposal to support the reform: from the Tambov, Volgograd, Stavropol regional parliaments and from the Legislative Assembly of St. Petersburg.Three more regions supported the bill with reservations.There are no negative reviews published on the Duma website.The government announced plans to raise the retirement age on the day the World Cup began, and it was then that the upcoming VAT increase became known.Following this, Russian sociologists recorded a sharp surge in public discontent, and the ratings of President Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev fell to a record low in the last five years..The Kremlin has been deliberately distancing itself from the reform all this time: Putin, like many governors, has not voiced his position on raising the retirement age.According to the latest FOM poll, more than half of Russians are currently dissatisfied with the actions of the authorities.Protests against the reform have already taken place in four dozen regions - they were organized by trade union movements, parliamentary parties (except United Russia), Yabloko and supporters of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.Full solidarity with the pension reform: Altai, Bashkortostan, Buryatia, Mordovia, Chuvashia, Khabarovsk Krai, Amur, Kaliningrad, Kirov, Leningrad, Tambov regions Cautious solidarity with the pension reform: Adygea, Komi, Udmurtia, Altai, Krasnoyarsk, Perm Krais, Kaluga, Lipetsk, Murmansk, Novgorod, Orenburg, Penza, Saratov, Sakhalin, Smolensk, Tula regions, St. Petersburg Soft distancing: Crimea, Yakutia, Arkhangelsk, Astrakhan, Voronezh, Ivanovo, Irkutsk, Magadan, Novosibirsk, Oryol, Ulyanovsk, Yaroslavl, Nenets, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug Shifting emphasis to counter social measures: Moscow, Moscow Region Loss of initiative by the authorities: Mari El, Khakassia Avoidance of a meaningful response: Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, Karelia, Tatarstan, Chechnya, Zabaikalsky, Kamchatka, Krasnodar, Primorsky, Stavropol Krais, Volgograd, Kemerovo, Omsk, Rostov, Samara, Sverdlovsk, Tver, Tomsk, Tyumen, Chelyabinsk Oblasts, Sevastopol, Jewish Autonomous Oblast, Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug No complete data on the reaction of the elites: Dagestan, Kalmykia, North Ossetia, Tuva, Belgorod, Bryansk, Vladimir, Vologda, Kostroma, Kurgan, Kursk, Nizhny Novgorod, Pskov, Ryazan Oblasts"}

The Russian prime minister has instructed his deputy Arkady Dvorkovich, as well as the ministries of agriculture, economic development and finance, to develop a draft amendment to the state program for 2013-2020, according to the text of the instruction published on the government website.The amendments should be aimed at \"developing the production of domestic agricultural products, which are largely dependent on imported supplies, taking into account long-term economic feasibility.\".The import of agricultural products from the EU, the US, Australia and Norway was banned on August 7 for a year in response to sanctions imposed by these countries against Russia over the annexation of Crimea and Moscow's alleged interference in the conflict in eastern Ukraine..According to Medvedev, issues of food security for the country are currently coming to the forefront.\"It's not just about retaliatory measures.The fact is that we have every opportunity to radically change the situation in agriculture, Medvedev noted..“We are essentially starting a new page in the development of agricultural production in our country.”.Igor Abakumov, a member of the public council at the Ministry of Agriculture and associate professor at the Timiryazev Russian State Agrarian University, admits that he is optimistic, but notes that the industry needs fundamental changes that cannot happen quickly.\"In order for fundamental changes to occur in agriculture, it is necessary to ensure that farmers have at least a break-even, if not a profitable existence.If in Russia the state support for one hectare of land is 500 rubles, then in Europe it is 500 euros,” Abakumov said in an interview with the BBC.According to Abakumov, by saying that Russia can feed itself, Medvedev is focusing on individual successful farms.\"We have farms that work better than European and American ones - these are the few that have retained their staff since before 1991..These are professionals who have maintained good relationships with bankers and who understand the strategy for developing global agriculture..These farms are like black sheep for us,” he explains..\"American substitution\" Deputy Chairman of the Committee of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry for the Development of the Agro-Industrial Complex Pavel Grudinin, who also heads the Lenin State Farm, believes that workers in the industry have not yet received specific guarantees from the authorities.\"Today, Rosselkhoznadzor, the Ministry of Agriculture and other officials have rushed to negotiate with anyone - Brazil, Argentina, China, Turkey, Azerbaijan - about replacing one imported product with another..That is, we are not talking about import substitution, but only about “Euro-” and “American substitution,” he said at a press conference on Tuesday..Following talks with Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Egypt had increased agricultural supplies to Russia by 30% and was ready to increase them by the same amount in the near future..In turn, the head of the Ministry of Agriculture Nikolai Fedorov said that his department is negotiating an increase in supplies from Turkey, Argentina and Peru..This issue is also being discussed with Iran, Israel, Morocco and Brazil..\"So far we have not heard that taxes will be reduced or eliminated for Russian agriculture, that financial support will be provided at the state level, that access to markets will be provided not just by talking about how we will go and monitor prices, but by economic, legal methods,\" Grudinin noted..According to the expert, so far the industry has received only one signal from the state - \"come on, start working\", and there is no guarantee that in a year, when production will already be increased, cheaper products from the West will not return to Russia.Steak as a state task The Russian Prime Minister intends to hold a meeting with the heads of Russia's leading agricultural regions in the near future to discuss which areas of agriculture need investment.You can buy a ribeye steak in any supermarket in Europe, but in Russia it is not easy. According to Medvedev, the changes in the state program should become an impetus for those areas of agriculture in Russia that \"have not developed before\" and are largely dependent on imports..Thus, the Prime Minister suggested asking the question why Russia buys apples from Poland, and stated that apples can also be grown in Stavropol.In addition, according to Medvedev, increasing the number of cattle should become an \"important state task\".As Igor Abakumov explains, we are talking primarily about bulls, from which high-quality meat is obtained..\"These are the same famous steaks, for example ribeye and so on..To do this, you don't just need to have a bull; you need to have what is called high technology for producing meat from grass..“But we have practically lost the culture of pastures; we have mainly stall production,” he notes..According to the expert, keeping animals indoors is motivated by the fact that Russia has a cold climate.\"But Montana has exactly the same weather..There, the bulls are kept under a roof only when they are being vaccinated, and this is only two days during their entire life, Abakumov continues..- Until the very end of his life, he walks in the open air - in the rain, in the cold, eats grass, at the final stage receives some additional feeding and, in the end, turns into a steak.\".According to Abakumov, it is necessary for agricultural products to be produced in Russia that meet world quality standards, and to do this it is necessary to change not only the approach to soil cultivation and livestock breeding, but also the attitude towards the consumer..\"I don't think that any changes, even if the state now throws everything at agriculture, will happen quickly,\" he emphasized.."}

In the 1960s, they were part of a group of physicists who tried to explain the physical phenomenon of mass in elementary particles. Their theory predicted the existence of a particle called the Higgs boson, which was discovered at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in 2012. In addition to Higgs and Englert, Carl Hagen, Tom Kibble, and Gerald Guralnik, as well as Robert Brout, who died in 2011, took part in developing the theory. Professor Ruben Sahakyan of University College London is confident that experimental physicists in Switzerland have indeed detected the very particle that Higgs and other theorists were talking about. Professor Sahakyan recalled that among the theorists who predicted the existence of such a particle were also Soviet physicists, including Alexander Polyakov. \"This year's prize is dedicated to something very small that explains everything else in our world,\" said Staffan Normark, permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. \"Recognition of the merits of fundamental science\" Francois Englert, a Belgian theoretical physicist specializing in statistical physics, quantum field theory, cosmology, string theory and supergravity, said he was very pleased with the award. \"At first I thought I had not received the prize because I missed the announcement,\" he said in Stockholm after a press conference at which the news was to be announced was postponed for more than an hour. \"I would like to congratulate all those who contributed to the discovery of this new particle and also thank my family, friends and colleagues for their support,\" said Professor Peter Higgs of the University of Edinburgh. \"I hope that this recognition of fundamental science will help to promote appreciation of the value of theoretical research,\" he added. CERN Director Rolf Heuer said he was delighted that this year's Nobel Prize had gone to particle physicists. \"The discovery of the Higgs boson at CERN last year, confirming the Brout-Engler-Higgs theory, marks the culmination of a long history of research involving many scientists from many countries,\" he said. The award ceremony will take place in Stockholm on December 10. Last year's Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Serge Haroche and David Wineland for \"pioneering techniques for manipulating quantum systems.\""}

President Neil Portnow is sure that they are not..\"It should be remembered that the outcome of the competition is decided not by the jury, but by the results of the vote of 14 thousand members of the Recording Academy,\" he says..“This is not a corporate decision, but a completely democratic process.”.Grammy Award Winning Albums from 1997 to 2017.However, many critics disagree..\"Even well-intentioned people often fail to recognize systemic racism,\" music critic John Vilanova wrote last year after Taylor Swift won the Grammy for best album title, beating out Kendrick Lamar..According to him, the very system of distributing performers into categories already contains invisible racial discrimination: for example, everyone knows that the category “contemporary urbanism” or “rhythm and blues” applies exclusively to black performers, where, in his opinion, they are squeezed out..This year, the prizes in these categories went to Beyoncé and her younger sister Solange.Meanwhile, music critic Kevin Powell opined that Beyoncé's Lemonade album, which tackled racism, police brutality and the oppression of women, was so unabashedly black that it made many listeners uncomfortable..\"We are still a country that does not want to face the truth,\" he said in an interview with CNN..- Adele's album is very strong, but it's all love songs..It is quite traditional, there is nothing daring or controversial about it, and it cannot be called innovative..And this was reflected in the voting of the Academy members.\".At the same time, the Grammy jury members were not obliged to reward Beyoncé's album for its social issues and civic sound, although it is obvious.In terms of commercial success, Adele's \"25\" was the most successful of all the albums that were nominated..It sold 9.2 million copies in the US alone, while Beyoncé's album only sold 1.6 million copies..More importantly, many musicians believe that the competition unfairly ignores black performers..It is for this reason that musicians such as Kanye West, Frank Ocean and even Justin Bieber have announced their refusal to participate in it this year..If the competition organisers do not pay attention to this, it may lose its cultural significance..But on the other hand, the Grammy Awards ceremony has never been about just the prizes..Beyoncé's incredible performance did more to boost her album's success than any other award in her trophy case, and she's already won 22 Grammys.Sales of her album \"Lemonade\" quadrupled after Sunday's ceremony..But Adele's album sales only doubled.."}

I'm sure you don't buy purple carrots often, and perhaps you've never even thought about their existence..I once asked a farmer at our local market which carrots were sweeter: orange or purple? And without hesitation he replied, \"Orange.\".Apparently, the more natural color was more delicious for him..But purple carrots, which owe their strange color to the pigment anthocyanin, have other important benefits..Anthocyanin is found in blueberries, black rice, and even the fall leaves of some trees..It acts as an antioxidant, slowing down oxidation, which is why it is actively used in the food industry..Another benefit of atocyanin is the rich color it gives to food products..In the UK and the EU, these pigments are permitted to be used as food colourings.Purple carrots are used as a dye in the most unexpected products, such as yogurt, to give it a berry color. Depending on their origin and chemical composition, anthocyanins can color products red, blue or purple..These natural dyes are used in products that, at first glance, have nothing to do with carrots..Scientists are experimenting with adding purple carrot juice or Peruvian berry B to yogurt.Bolivian.Researchers are growing purple corn and have also found that the purple dye also gives milk an attractive, vibrant hue..You probably suspect another substitution if you have ever read the labels on exotic fruit juices..The base of most of them is usually regular apple or grape juice..The UK consumer rights organisation Which? published a report in 2012 noting that Tesco's mango and passion fruit smoothies contained 47% apple juice, 23% mango puree and 4% passion fruit puree..Cheap juices can easily be given an exotic and expensive taste.Blue wine from Spanish company Gïk Blue is another example of experimenting with the taste and color of food products Today, the recommendations regarding what a product label should contain have changed.EU law requires that \"the name of the product must consist of a list of the fruits used in it, in descending order of the amount of juice and puree it contains.\".Thus, drinks made from lychee, passion fruit, mango and other exotic fruits that contain a large amount of apple juice should be called accordingly - \"Apple and Mango Juice\".(Tests have shown that passion fruit peel, which contains a lot of fibre, can be added to yoghurts, allowing them to be sold as \"probiotic\".Sometimes exotic ingredients are added to completely ordinary products just for the sake of advertising).However, all these substitutions and disguises can also serve a more interesting purpose - an attempt to reproduce an elusive and complex taste by breaking it down into understandable ingredients..For example, a flavor enhancer can be added to orange juice, which will even more convincingly tell the consumer: \"This is an orange.\".As Alyssa Hamilton, author of Fresh Squeezed, explains in an interview with The New Yorker, \"Fragrance and flavor companies—the same ones that make high-end perfumes—break down orange essence and oils into their constituent substances and then combine them in configurations that don't occur in nature.\".\"Among the chemicals that are added in large doses to orange juice sold in North American markets is ethyl butyrate..Flavor experts have found that it imparts a flavor to the drink that Americans like and that reminds them of freshly squeezed orange.\".With the help of food additives that enhance the natural flavor, orange juice becomes even more orange. However, it turns out that artificially creating a universal taste is not so easy..Many years ago, the confectionery company Jelly Belly developed a recipe for a pumpkin pie-flavored jelly candy..The company specializes in producing quite original flavors..A few years ago, Vice President Lisa Brasher asked me, \"When you say 'pickle,' do you mean sweet or more of a dill flavor?\" \"And potato chips - regular or barbecue flavor? Those are big questions for us.\".Pumpkin pie is one of the main dishes that Americans prepare for Thanksgiving and is associated with personal memories in every family..Jelly Belly candies come in a variety of flavors, including pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving. However, the candies with this flavor turned out to be too original and did not evoke the desired associations..Family memories are very personal.The candies had to be taken out of production.However, in 2014 they were brought back to the market as a seasonal offering..This time, the company carefully thought out the advertising of the candies, focusing on the uniqueness of individual taste preferences: \"Every family has its own pumpkin pie recipe, and the Jelly Belly family has one too.\".Now, when you try probiotic yogurt, drink orange juice, or purple milk if it ever hits the market, pay attention to the flavors..Whether we like it or not, food chemistry has long been a part of our lives..And we can only marvel at the ingenuity of its producers..You can read the original of this article in English on the BBC Future website.Follow our news on Twitter and Telegram."}

More than 300 people attended the prayer service in the Church of the Icon of the Mother of God \"Joy of All Who Sorrow\" on Bolshaya Ordynka. On December 25, 1812 (January 7, 1813, according to the new style), Alexander I issued a manifesto announcing the expulsion of the enemy from the borders of the fatherland. By a decree of 1814, the emperor ordered that the holiday \"Liberation of the Church and the Russian State from the Invasion of the Gauls\" be celebrated annually on Christmas Day. It was as a token of gratitude for the victory in the Patriotic War of 1812 that the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, later blown up by the Bolsheviks and restored in the 1990s, was erected in Moscow, on the walls of which the names of its heroes are carved. Six-month campaign On December 14, 1812, the last remnants of Napoleon's 600,000-strong \"Great Army\", numbering 1,600 people, crossed the Russian-Prussian border in a westerly direction. Eight days earlier, the French emperor had left his troops under the command of marshals and left for Paris to conduct a new mobilization. On June 24, Napoleon crossed the Neman with an army three times larger than the Russian forces, and in less than six months suffered a complete defeat. The losses of the French and their allies amounted to about 550 thousand killed and died from wounds, diseases and frostbite, and about 50 thousand captured. Historians see the main reasons for Russia's victory in the patriotic upsurge that engulfed all strata of the population, geographic and natural factors, and the correct calculation of Commander-in-Chief Mikhail Kutuzov, who chose the tactic of \"starving out\" the occupiers. \"Public Discussion\" The head of the Department of External Church Relations of the Moscow Patriarchate, Hieromonk Philipp Ryabykh, who performed a prayer service on Thursday, said in an interview with Ekho Moskvy that \"our country traces its origins not back to 1917, but to the time of the baptism of Rus.\" He called for a \"public discussion\" and for the 200th anniversary of the victory in the Patriotic War of 1812 to be made a national holiday. Representative of the Council of Muftis of Russia Gulnur Gazeeva called the initiative of the Orthodox Church \"interesting.\" She recalled that Russian Muslims made a significant contribution to the victory over Napoleon, in commemoration of which Alexander I allowed the first mosque to be built in Moscow. Meanwhile, in St. Petersburg, the day of the expulsion of the French from Russia was marked by a parade of military-historical clubs on the Semenovsky parade ground in the presence of the clergy and officials.

In foreigners' perceptions of Russia, drunkenness is a byword.Reality or myth (many historians, including the current Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky, angrily refute Russian drunkenness as a myth), but this idea has firmly established itself in the mass consciousness..Artist P.Sabine's.1988.The caption under the poster in Ukrainian: \"Loud fun - bitter hangover\" It must be said that the attitude towards it is not so much indignant and condemnatory as good-natured and ironic.With a fair amount of curiosity.It is not surprising because both the exhibition itself and the accompanying several evening meetings devoted to various aspects of alcohol consumption and the fight against this consumption both in the USSR and in the post-Soviet space are very popular..Artist S.Smirnov, 1988.The exhibition is based on an extensive collection of Soviet anti-alcohol posters from the 1960s to 1980s, collected by British artists Damon Murray and Stephen Sorrell..Most of them date back to the second half of the 1980s, the period of the large-scale campaign launched by the General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee Mikhail Gorbachev to combat drunkenness..Artist P.D. Egorov, 1987.The posters collected in the book and presented at the exhibition are a stunning historical document, a monument to a political campaign incredible in its scope and consequences, which coincided with the final period of the existence of the USSR..At the same time, these posters are a brilliant example of Soviet propaganda graphics that were practically lost after the collapse of the USSR..Its roots go back to the avant-garde of the 1920s, and its visual and textual solutions echo the legacy of Mayakovsky, Rodchenko, and El Lissitzky..Artist P.Zharinov, 1977.It is no exaggeration to say that the political propaganda poster is almost the only form of Soviet art that has maintained direct continuity with the avant-garde of the 1920s throughout the entire existence of the USSR..After the collapse of communism, the political propaganda poster died out as a form and genre of art..It was replaced by advertising - a completely different story, and much less interesting for the West.The posters look great on the walls of the Pushkin House The small rooms of the Pushkin House turned out to be ideal for the poster exhibition.You seem to be immersed in a completely different reality, finding yourself in a time and place very far from today's London.Artist unknown.1986.For some people - and not just for former citizens of the USSR living in London, but also for those who have visited the Soviet Union - this is almost a nostalgic trip, a journey into the irretrievably gone past..For others, it is an introduction to a bygone historical reality..No movement in space will now allow one to immerse oneself in this reality..Exhibition - a journey through time.The evening program accompanying the exhibition is no less interesting..Writer and stand-up comedian Will Hobson as Venichka at the evening \"A Treatise on Hiccups\" \"A Treatise on Hiccups\" - that was the name of the evening dedicated to Venedikt Erofeev.\"Moscow-Petushki\" - a funny, tragic, great poem about the holy alcoholic Venichka sounded in a wonderful translation into English, mixed with footage from a film about him shot literally a year before the writer's death by the British director Pavel Pavlikovsky.(A year ago, Pawlikowski's film \"Ida\" won an Oscar for best foreign language film).Of course, an evening dedicated to Venichka could not do without tasting some cocktails, the recipes of which are scattered in abundance throughout the pages of the great book..Artist I.Maistrovsky 1977.Of course, the evening's organizers took care of the visitors' stomachs..The most gentle cocktails were chosen: without polish, foot antiperspirant and Sadko shampoo..On the other hand, where can you find such exotic ingredients in London? Gorbachev's \"dry law\" is traditionally perceived as an extremely unsuccessful measure, the results of which were a sharp increase in the consumption of surrogate alcohol and the destruction of elite vineyards in Crimea, Moldova and Georgia.Artist E.Bor, 1985.Another evening at the Pushkin House poses the question from an unexpected angle: \"Gorbachev's Prohibition: the most successful intervention in the health care system in history?\" The key to the evening's title remains the question mark: did the ban really help reduce alcoholism or was it one of the last unsuccessful social experiments of the late USSR?

you also need to figure out how to deliver his goods to Russia.The problems cited here include the centralization of food warehouses in Moscow, as well as sea ports concentrated in the northwest of the country..However, not everyone is inclined to see big problems here..\"Recently, warehouses have been developing, new supply routes are being developed.I don't really understand what kind of difficulties there could be here..“Everything will be fine,” reassures the executive director of the Retail Trade Association, Andrey Karpov..In his opinion, it will take one and a half to two months to set up the new system, and the buyer will not even notice anything, because large chains and distributors have sufficient stocks of products..For a few more weeks, you will be able to find names banned by Russian authorities on store shelves.Loans and tricks He is echoed by Elena Tyurina, head of the Institute of Agricultural Marketing.\"Maritime logistics [that is, transporting products by sea] is generally quite inexpensive.In addition, 85% of imports, for example, of beef, come from Latin American countries, and if it is necessary to transport something else, the routes have already been worked out,” she reasons..Much more now depends on whether the Russian authorities will be able to create conditions for Russian producers – both in terms of access to the market and the creation of additional production capacities, BBC sources note..\"It is important to understand what will be compensated to our producers, whether they will be provided with the necessary credit support so that they can expand production.If this does not happen, then very soon we will see negativity,” says Vera Kononova from the Institute for Comprehensive Strategic Studies.It is precisely with loans that difficulties may arise: after all, it is mainly state banks that provide loans to farmers, and they themselves are currently experiencing sanctions pressure from Europe and the US - and are working in conditions of reduced access to foreign money.Another circumstance pointed out by experts interviewed by the BBC Russian Service has an ethical dimension.Traders often take advantage of any opportunity to raise prices..So, amidst all the noise about Russian “anti-sanctions,” many of them may raise prices unjustifiably..But it won't be easy to figure out the real reason right away.."}

A man came to my room, put something in my pocket and then I was detained,\" Whelan told the court on Tuesday (quoted by Interfax). Whelan said the man was an FSB officer he had known for 10 years. \"There was absolutely no reason for him to be in my room,\" Whelan said. When asked by a BBC correspondent, Whelan said he did not know whether the flash drive found on him actually contained classified information. \"I didn't even know I had it until I was arrested. It was a complete provocation,\" he said. As Whelan's lawyer Vladimir Zherebenkov previously stated, his client thought the flash drive he was given contained \"information for tourists in Russia, including about churches.\" Whelan could not have seen what was on the flash drive in advance, and took it because he does not know Russian, the lawyer claimed. When the court announced its decision on Tuesday, Whelan spoke loudly, calling his case absurd. Whelan's case US citizen Paul Whelan was detained in Moscow on December 28, 2018. It was later discovered that he had three other citizenships - Great Britain, Ireland, and Canada. He turned to the embassies of all these countries in Russia for help. Whelan was charged under Article 276 of the Russian Criminal Code (espionage). The flash drive seized from him contained information constituting a state secret. According to investigators, Whelan worked for the US intelligence services. The former Marine and head of security services at several firms denies the accusations and says he came to Moscow for a friend's wedding. \"I know the name of my friend, but I won't say it out of concern for his privacy,\" Whelan's brother David told the BBC earlier. Paul's family is also confident in his innocence.

Among the activists was deputy Volodymyr Parasyuk. At night, he reported that seven activists were in the Slavyansk district police department. And his father was hospitalized because he was injured by tear gas, the deputy said. The police, for their part, claim that several security officials were injured in the Slavyansk conflict. The head of the Donetsk region police said that law enforcement officers received serious threats against their families during the clash. Therefore, a criminal case was opened under the article on threats or violence against police officers. The clash between law enforcement officers who were serving at the Slavyansk checkpoint and armed men occurred the previous evening. The armed men refused to undergo inspection and tried to break through the checkpoint, there were about 60 of them, the police said. \"If they had behaved normally, we would have inspected the car and they would have driven on. They wanted to show their aggression... The deputy's car hit a police officer,\" law enforcement officers say. The police opened a criminal case under Part 2 of Article 345 \"Threat or violence against a law enforcement officer.\" Donetsk Oblast Police Chief Vyacheslav Abroskin said that the law enforcement officers were threatened. \"They insulted and humiliated the police officers, 'you are all Donetsk separatists' - the law enforcement officers are talking about 'communication' with the people's deputy,\" he wrote on Facebook. Tear gas used At the same time, Mr. Parasyuk was told that the police used tear gas. The deputy's assistant Irina Holub told Ukrayinska Pravda about this. \"Just now, at a checkpoint in Slavyansk, the police beat up volunteers who were traveling in a column to support the blockade! There are casualties. \"KORD used tear gas,\" she wrote on her Facebook page. Parasyuk also claimed that the police fired. Deputy Semyon Semenchenko also reported this on his Facebook page. The column of 13 vehicles was eventually allowed into the ATO zone - as Mr. Abroskin reported, it was heading towards Bakhmut. But, according to the police, at about 10 p.m. the activists were spotted near Kramatorsk and detained. The police admit that warning shots were fired into the air during these events. Last week, Donetsk Oblast Police Chief Vyacheslav Abroskin issued a ban on weapons being brought into the region until the end of the anti-terrorist operation, even if there is a permit to own them. This is explained by the desire to protect people from crimes involving firearms. On March 13, 45 activists were detained in the ATO zone for blocking rail traffic with uncontrolled regions. The blockade headquarters reported that the detainees were beaten. Police beatings denied. Later, all those detained were released."}

At the same time, the organization launched the hashtag #EUsaveAleppo on Twitter and calls on its supporters to call the Russian embassies in their countries and express their discontent. The day before, Russia announced that on November 4, there would be another humanitarian pause in Aleppo. During the cessation of hostilities, Russian military personnel are offering extremists remaining in the city to leave it. The British press wrote that President Vladimir Putin is planning a new large-scale offensive on Aleppo - with catastrophic humanitarian consequences for the 250,000 civilians remaining in the city. Putin intends to take advantage of the fact that America is unlikely to be able to do anything other than its own presidential elections in the coming week, the British Times wrote.

Are you going to conduct a special operation? We don't have any militants here...- CTO mode has been introduced in \"X\", we can't say anything more, hurry up...- It's good that it's not a war.....Neighbors gather behind the cordon, wondering who exactly they have come for, listening to the conversations of people in camouflage.Evacuation of civilians from the counter-terrorist operation zone in Dagestan More time passes when, according to rumors, it turns out that three people suspected of \"terrorist activity\" are blocked in the house.Another one is a young man, the owner of the house, whose wife and child came out half an hour ago to answer the call to surrender..The father of the young man, who law enforcement officials would later call an accomplice of the militants, tries in vain to persuade his son to surrender to the authorities over the phone....It doesn't work.Smoke.Shooting.State of shock.Neighbours pray that their home will not be affected by fire.People think about material things during a fight, and don’t wish good luck to the security forces.Ordinary people in Dagestan, far from politics, have not trusted anyone for a long time.It cannot be said that they sympathize with the militants, but they do not trust law enforcement either..Most likely, they will not hand over suspicious people to the security forces, knowing that their house could burn down from a shell that flew in by mistake or be hit by a \"flat iron\" (as people call the process of destroying a house to the ground during special operations)..If the house burns down, the owners will be doomed to misery and will receive only meager compensation..After talking to his son, the elderly father sits motionless on the curb until the shooting stops..\"That's it,\" he says quietly, realizing that the silence means one thing - his son is no longer alive..The old man does not blame either the security forces or the militants: “That means I missed something, that means I didn’t explain something...\"The next morning the \"CTO regime\" in the settlement will be lifted.The National Anti-Terrorism Committee will dryly report on the number of \"destroyed members of illegal armed groups\" (ed..), among which will be another \"amir\" of one of the \"sectors\" into which the militants have conditionally divided Dagestan.Protracted CTOs It also happens that CTOs are not limited to one day, but drag on for weeks or even months, as in the village of Gimry.Similar counter-terrorist operations during the two Chechen campaigns were popularly called \"cleansings\".And even in our time this word can often be heard from the residents of the once again blockaded village of Gimry.The special regime has been introduced here several times, starting in 2007..Then it lasted for almost a year and a half, and the one introduced in April 2013 continues to this day..Local residents have long been accustomed to the presence of military equipment and various units of security forces and the military in the village..They have adapted to the curfew that has been in effect for the entire duration of the military operation, and they react more calmly to searches of their homes and checks of databases of unreliable people..If the previous story is more of an artistic generalization of the standard development of the situation in the \"CTO zone\", then now I will tell a story about the real events that unfolded in the village of Gimry on April 11, 2013..That day, there was a battle in the forest near the village, which suddenly turned into shooting on the outskirts.No one announced an evacuation, and people fled the village in panic to the sound of grenades and gunfire..When leaving their homes, many not only forgot to take valuables with them, but simply left their houses wide open.Shooting and explosions were heard all day and night, which local residents spent in the village of Vremenny, three kilometers from the village of Gimry..The residents of Gimry learned that the village was blocked and a counter-terrorist operation regime was introduced only the next day..Residents of Gimry found themselves \"between two fires\" Explosions were heard in the following days.According to security forces, they detonated shells found in houses where relatives of militants lived..It is worth noting that the explosions were carried out directly inside residential buildings..The security forces will act similarly on May 6, 2013 in Buinaksk, where the houses of three families, whose relatives included militants, will also be blown up..Later, locals reported that valuables, furniture and equipment had disappeared or been damaged from their homes..As in Chechnya, in Gimry local residents found human excrement right in the rooms of their homes.They recalled that the cattle, frightened by the shooting, either ran away across the fields or died of hunger..Despite all the complaints of Gimry residents against the security forces, most villagers note that, compared to previous years, representatives of the security forces behaved more politely with the local population.For example, if earlier Gimry residents complained that \"outsiders\" provoked conflicts with \"locals\", this time this was not observed.The military does not walk around the village bare-chested and does not openly drink alcohol, as they did before..The main problem for the Gimry residents is that they are \"caught between two fires\", since almost every resident of the village is closely or distantly related to the militants..And it is not customary to give away one's own in the Caucasus Mountains.Even at the request of the head of Dagestan.Therefore, no matter how much the Gimry residents want peace and tranquility, as long as the confrontation continues, they will remain hostages of circumstances..In collaboration with the online media \"Caucasian Knot\""}

A question for experts.Here it is necessary to conduct an expert assessment of the state of communications and the airfield after the shelling..Regarding its strategic importance.Remember the Crimean events: the Russian troops that occupied Crimea first of all captured all Crimean airfields.These are strategic objects, important communication centers..As well as major sea ports and railway junctions.Alexey Melnik, co-director of the foreign policy and international security programs at the Center.Razumkova: It is obvious that as soon as the separatists capture the airport, aviation will appear there.Then the scale of the conflict will become completely different..This aircraft is already stationed in Crimea.After all, the planes that the Russian army transferred to Ukraine were faulty..But the operating aircraft remained.It was not a coincidence.Planes do not necessarily have to fly from Donetsk airport.The main thing for the separatists is to establish that they have an airport and that planes take off from there..In fact, even now there is nothing stopping aviation from flying in from the other side of the Russian-Ukrainian border (Russia denies its involvement in the conflict in the East - Ed..).But now all this will be presented as allegedly captured \"DPR\" planes by separatists.What is important is that all these military actions for the airport are taking place during a ceasefire..Separatists accuse Ukrainian troops of violating peace in other areas, but here they themselves report their attempts to storm the airport.This indicates that they do not intend to stop within the boundaries of the conditional zone determined during the peace talks..Igor Semivolos, Director of the Center for Middle East Studies: Donetsk Airport was initially controlled by Ukrainian troops, so there is no point in leaving there.This object appears to serve as an important staging area..In the event of its loss in the absence of natural obstacles, we may find ourselves facing the threat of an offensive from the Donetsk airport to cities controlled by Ukrainian forces: in the direction of Konstantinovka, Kramatorsk, Slavyansk, etc..d.As far as we can understand, the airport cannot be attacked from all sides..Therefore, it can be defended much more easily..If we can hold this facility, which is an obstacle to the deployment of the separatists' offensive, why should we leave it?"}

I've long wanted to see what Gagauzia is like.I have often heard from Moldovans that they have little in common with the Gagauz, and many of them have never even been to Gagauzia - they only know that it is somewhere in the south of Moldova.Three hours by bus from Chisinau, and you are in the capital of Gagauzia - Comrat.The first thing that catches your eye is how much of it is in Russian.It was like being in the Russian provinces.Russian coexists on signs and markers with Gagauz, which is similar to Turkish..\"Gagauzia is our Motherland! When we are united, we are invincible!\" Communism and Orthodoxy are two symbols that many here still hold in their minds. In 1990, the proclamation of the Gagauz Republic, unlike Transnistria, was bloodless, and it existed in an unrecognized status for four years..In 1994, Gagauzia peacefully became part of Moldova as an autonomous territorial entity (ATO), and now more than 165 thousand people live there..Human.Considering that the people are Turkic, it would be logical to find mosques in the city.But in the very center of Comrat there is a beautiful Orthodox church..I meet parishioners.\"They look and speak like Turks, but their mentality is more Russian,\" they say about themselves..You can hear from the Gagauz that they are the only Turkic-speaking people who profess Orthodoxy.True, there are also Yakuts, Altai people, Chuvashes, Khakassians...Türkiye, as the leader of the Turkic world, has been actively helping the Gagauz autonomy for many years.But at the same time, the Gagauz, being Orthodox, have a very warm attitude towards Russia, whose assistance is of great importance here..The Ataturk Library in Comrat was built by Turkey as a gift to the Gagauz people. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) also provides Gagauzia with grants for the development of infrastructure, agriculture, and municipal needs. The ATO territory is small, three towns and villages..The Bashkan, or head of state in our language, manages all of this..Despite the fact that the goal of creating the autonomy was to preserve Gagauz traditions and language, the language spoken here is mainly Russian..Although there are three official languages: Moldovan, Russian and Gagauz.It looks quite unusual: you seem to be in Moldova, but everyone speaks Russian.Here they watch Russian TV, signs are in Russian, education is in Russian, the press is in Russian, they swear in Russian.Many people here speak and understand Moldovan with difficulty, which causes many problems..Let's say, with employment or education in Chisinau.In Comrat, city authorities are putting wells in order In the city park, the St. Demetrius Convent in Ceadir-Lunga And in conversations, the Gagauz make it clear that they feel closer to Russia than to Moldova.Unlike the rest of Moldova, Gagauzia has close economic ties with Russia, which has opened its market to local agricultural exporters..Russian universities have quotas for students from Gagauzia.As if not in Moldova - Russian language is everywhere Newspapers in Gagauzia are published both in Russian and in Gagauz Of course, you can hear Gagauz speech, although mainly from old people.But now, all over Gagauzia, road signs are being installed with the names of cities and villages in the Gagauz language, and books have begun to be published in the Gagauz language..In 2016, the Gagauz parliament, to the sharp criticism of Chisinau, adopted its own Education Code, different from the general Moldovan one - in particular, now the subject \"History and Culture of the Gagauz People\" is taught in the Gagauz language in local schools..Moldova called the decision illegal, but Gagauzia believes that its autonomous status allows it to be adopted.The office of the Gagauz television company Yeni Ay against the backdrop of an Orthodox cathedral Agriculture is one of the main pillars of the autonomy's economy There is a problem with work in the autonomy.The people are mainly engaged in winemaking and agriculture..If Moldovans go to work in Europe or Russia, then the Gagauz, due to the similarity of languages, also find work in Turkey.Work can be found in the vineyards Georgy Cherven, head of the KaraGani winery, pours young, slightly fermented wine Uncle Vanya from Vulcanesti went to neighboring Romania for tomatoes this morning, and to Ukraine for apples, they are cheaper there, he told me Mikhail Triboi, a photographer from Estonia, his blog on LiveJournal is 3boi.livejournal.com"}

I think we need to consider all possible ways to prevent them from falling into Russian hands, since this would give it weapons that it does not currently have,\" the minister emphasized. Earlier this month, French President Francois Hollande suspended the transfer of the first Mistral-class helicopter carrier to Russia. The reason given was the crisis in Ukraine, in which the Kremlin is accused of involvement. Hollande named the conditions for the transfer of the helicopter carrier to Russia - a ceasefire and a political settlement of the situation in eastern Ukraine. At the same time, the final decision on the transfer of the ships was postponed until the end of October. French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian emphasized that this decision by the French authorities is not a refusal to transfer the ships or a suspension of the transfer process. \"Call it what you will: a warning, a lead,\" the French minister explained. It later became known that the trials of the first ship, scheduled for September 10, had also been postponed. Two months ago, 400 Russian sailors, the future crew of the ship, arrived in the French port of Saint-Nazaire in the west of the country, where the construction of the first Mistral is being completed. French President Hollande promised to suspend the transfer of the Mistrals to Russia due to the events in Ukraine. The United States and other French allies in the North Atlantic Alliance put pressure on Paris over the issue of transferring these helicopter carriers to Russia. Supporters of transferring the ships to Russia responded by saying that France needed to rid its international trade of outside pressure. The first Mistral-class helicopter carrier (in Russia it was decided to call it Vladivostok) was to be delivered to Russia in early November. The construction of the second helicopter carrier (Sevastopol) continues in the French port of Saint-Nazaire. Its transfer to Russia was scheduled for 2015. The deal is valued at 1.2 billion euros, of which Russia has already paid about 700 million euros. At the same time, many experts have already noted that France may face a fine of 251 million euros for failure to comply with the terms of delivery of the ships."}

{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content in one sentence..Churyumov's colleague: \"A comet is a time machine\"\nKlim Churyumov monitored the module's descent to the comet he discovered The comet, which was discovered in 1969 by two Ukrainians, is now located at a distance from us several times greater than the distance from the Earth to the Sun.After three jumps across the surface of the celestial body, the Philae module still managed to stay in place, although how stable it was fixed there is still not entirely clear..The gravity of a 10 billion ton comet is too weak to hold any body firmly on it..The Rosetta probe, which delivered a lander to the comet, is being called a new success of space science that will help uncover the secrets of the origin of the solar system.The comet's discoverers, astronomers Klim Churyumov and Svetlana Gerasimenko, monitored the module's landing from the German Aerospace Center in Cologne.Churyumov's colleague Igor Lukyanchuk, deputy director of the observatory at the Taras Shevchenko University of Kiev, told BBC Ukrainian Service correspondent Oleg Karpyak why landing on a comet is such an important event for science.Igor Lukyanchuk: Rosetta is the first spacecraft in orbit around a comet's nucleus.Before this, all flights to comets were flybys - the device passed by, took pictures, measurements and flew on..It is also the first spacecraft that will fly alongside a comet as it approaches the Sun, and will track everything that happens dynamically..Right now it is still far from the Sun, so there is practically no activity on the surface, only very weak gas emission..The closer the comet gets to the Sun, the more its surface will heat up, gases will be released, which will capture dust and form the phenomenon that we see in the sky - a comet with a beautiful tail..But since the comet's surface will become increasingly warmer as it approaches the Sun, the module will only be able to receive data until March next year..After this the temperature will become too high.BBC: Why was Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko chosen for this mission? And.L.: The first launch of the Rosetta project was planned for 2003, and the object was supposed to be Comet Wirtanen.Objects are selected based on the lowest energy and, accordingly, financial costs.That is, it should fly close and in a place where it will be easier for us to launch the device with minimal costs..In 2003, the window for launching a probe to Comet Wirtanen was unfortunately missed due to technical problems with the Ariane 5 launch vehicle that was supposed to launch Rosetta into orbit..But in such large and expensive projects, of course, a backup option is provided..It was comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.Both comets are periodic..But Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko became periodic only 10 years before its discovery in 1969..Before that, it entered the Solar System, flew past Jupiter, which changed its orbit, and it became one of the short-period comets of the Jupiter family..BBC: How was it discovered? And.L.: Lyudmila Gerasimenko, who now works in Tajikistan, was at that time, in 1969, a graduate student at Shevchenko University and worked under the supervision of Sergei Vsekhsvyatsky, the founder of the world-famous comet school.And Klim Churyumov was a research fellow at the university..And Sergei Vsekhsvyatsky then sent all his employees to search for new comets..He sent them to Alma-Ata to observe the comet Comas Sola..Back then, everything was photographed on large glass plates..They observed this Comas Sola and at first thought that there was a defect in their four pictures, because the shape and other parameters of the comet were different from what they expected..Having six photographs of the comet taken on different days, they calculated the elements of its orbit, compared them with the elements of the orbit of Comas Sola and saw that it was a completely different comet..They sent all the data to the Bureau of Astronomical Telegrams in the USA, and they confirmed that it was a new comet and named it Churyumov-Gerasimenko..BBC: Why bother studying comets and spending huge amounts of money on it? And.L.: The Rosetta project could change, confirm or refute our ideas about the formation of the solar system.The Philae module on the surface of a comet According to our ideas, the Solar System was formed from a protoplanetary cloud.Due to its rotation and gravitational influence, a separation of matter occurred: heavy elements, dust, moved closer to the Sun, and lighter elements - water, ice, frozen gases - moved to the edge of the Solar System..That is why all the planets of the so-called terrestrial group are solid, for example, Venus, Earth, Mars..And Jupiter, Saturn and beyond are frozen liquid and gases..According to this theory, comets formed at the edge of the solar system, where the so-called Kuiper belt is located..Due to various disturbances, these cometary nuclei fall into the inner part of the solar system and become comets..And all the matter from which they were formed is the same matter from which the solar system was formed..Moreover, by studying this substance, we are studying the physical conditions in which the solar system was created..The comet is a time machine that gives us the opportunity to look into the past of the solar system.BBC: Will this comet ever be visible to the naked eye? And.L.: Without the help of a telescope - no, but with a telescope - you can..In the 1980s, it was closer to Earth and had a ninth magnitude, meaning it could be seen with binoculars..The human eye can distinguish the fifth or sixth magnitude, but only if you look at a dark sky outside a large city [the smaller the magnitude, the brighter the object - Ed..].This comet's perihelion - its closest point to the Sun - lies beyond Earth's orbit..That is, it reaches this point, turns around and flies back to Jupiter..The bright comets we see from Earth tend to fly closer to the Sun..BBC: How did you feel when the European Space Agency announced on Tuesday that the spacecraft had landed on the comet?.L.: Now we read more news about what is happening in the east of Ukraine, so of course it is nice and joyful, but the feeling could be much better.And more people could come to watch the live broadcast because it is truly an outstanding event.."}

The Office of the High Commissioner is also concerned that heavy weapons are still located near the contact line..\"If the shelling doesn't start at 10pm, I can't sleep,\" one local resident was quoted as saying..Both Ukrainian military and pro-Russian militants continue to use civilian property and infrastructure..During the reporting period, ten incidents were documented that resulted in damage to water supply facilities..The fighting also continues to pose a threat to industrial facilities storing hazardous materials, the report added..Freedom of opinion The UN is concerned about the broad interpretation of the provisions of the Criminal Code of Ukraine concerning terrorism, as well as provisions on treason and encroachment on territorial integrity in cases against journalists and bloggers.During the reporting period, at least three people were arrested and one man was given a suspended sentence for social media posts..Another journalist is in custody in a pretrial detention center in Zhitomir.He is accused of treason and terrorism due to his publications..\"The lack of accountability for crimes against journalists is a matter of grave concern.There has been virtually no progress in the investigation of recent physical attacks on media workers and the high-profile cases of the murders of Pavel Sheremet and Oles Buzina,\" the report says..The OHCHR also described as a \"worrying trend\" that foreign journalists covering the conflict in eastern Ukraine are being labeled as \"propagandists\" and deported from Ukraine on this basis: \"Three journalists from the Russian Federation and two from Spain have been detained, interrogated and deported from Ukraine in connection with their professional activities.\".At the same time, freedom of expression remains significantly limited in separatist-controlled territory, the report added: \"Critical publications or alternative points of view are not allowed in the media operating in the 'Donetsk People's Republic' and 'Luhansk People's Republic'.\".Militants continue to hold blogger Stanislav Aseyev, who was detained on June 3, in custody, while another blogger in the self-proclaimed \"LPR\" was \"sentenced to 14 years in prison for extremism and espionage\".Not all religious communities can freely assemble in the self-proclaimed republics. There are also problems for religious communities, in particular Jehovah's Witnesses, who have their property confiscated in territories not controlled by Kyiv and are generally prohibited from assembling..In its report, OHCHR makes recommendations on how to improve matters in Ukraine to the government, the self-proclaimed republics, the Russian authorities and the international community.At the same time, they note that most of the recommendations made in previous reports have not yet been implemented and remain relevant..This is already the 20th UN report on human rights in Ukraine.."}

\"The courts' findings on the evidence of Naama's drug smuggling did not stand up to any legal criticism,\" says lawyer Zinchenko.- The paradox is that even the presidential pardon does not solve the issue of serious reputational losses for the system after the Naama case..But everything could really be simpler - legally and humanely.The court had plenty of arguments for the defense in this case.\".Israeli media reported that Moscow was ready to hand over Issachar to Israeli authorities in exchange for hacker Alexei Burkov, who was detained in December 2015 at Tel Aviv airport at the request of the United States..The Israeli woman's relatives even appealed to the court with a request to cancel the Russian's extradition to the United States, calling Issachar a \"diplomatic hostage.\".However, in November 2019, the Israeli authorities handed Burkov over to the Americans..Bloomberg, citing its sources familiar with the discussion of Issachar's case in the Kremlin, wrote that Putin does not want to release the Israeli so as not to increase the rating of Netanyahu, who is expecting his third snap parliamentary elections in a year in early March.."}

This is usually a purely theoretical question.It's funny to think about how you would feel if you suddenly found yourself in the body of a neighbor, a celebrity, or even your own dog..But this is impossible to achieve – at least it seems so to us..However, several people were able to experience what it was like to get into someone else's skin..Virtual reality technology helped them.\"The first few seconds are just incredible,\" says Rick Frances Wahl, a woman who temporarily transformed into a man..- It's so weird..Gradually you begin to feel more comfortable, and then you begin to fantasize: what if this were your real body?.Val, an actress, model and artist, was one of the participants in a body swap experiment at the Be Different Lab, a project by a group of Barcelona-based artists..She got her new body thanks to a device called \"A Machine to Be Different\".The technology is relatively simple..Both users wear helmets to move into virtual reality, with video cameras attached to the top of the helmets..The image from your camera is transmitted to the other person, and vice versa: what you see in front of you is what your partner sees.If he or she raises their hand, you see it..If you do it, your partner will see it as his movement..Rikke Francis Wahl (left) swapped bodies with her boyfriend using a virtual reality headset. To get used to the sight of another person's body (but without the ability to control it), participants begin by moving their arms and legs slowly so that their partner can follow suit..After a while, these slow, synchronous movements become more comfortable, and participants begin to feel as if they are actually living in another person's body..\"It's so natural,\" says Val, laughing, \"and at the same time it's so unnatural.\".When Val \"swapped bodies\" with her partner, Philippe Bertrand, an artist working at the Be Different lab, they ended the process by stripping down to their underwear.This is what Val remembers when she talks about the experiment..\"We were standing in our underwear, I looked down at myself and saw a completely male body there, dressed in completely male underwear.\"That's what stuck in my memory the most,\" she admits..The most intriguing thing about this story is that such technology could change people's behavior after the experiment, potentially for the better..Research has shown that virtual reality can be effectively used to combat hidden racism, prejudice against those who look or speak differently from you..Researchers at the University of Barcelona asked respondents to complete a questionnaire called the Hidden Association Test..Among other things, the responses measured the extent to which the word \"black\" was associated with terms such as \"bad,\" \"good,\" \"athletic,\" or \"awkward.\".Then the group of subjects was offered to try out the possibility of controlling the body of a dark-skinned avatar using a virtual reality helmet and then take the association test again..The second time around, participants in the experiment had lower levels of implicit bias.Another study found that the same effect could be achieved using the \"rubber hand illusion,\" in which the subject watches the movements of a rubber hand positioned so that it appears to be his own..If the rubber hand is a color different from the subject's skin color, then his subsequent indicators of latent racism are lower than when the hand is \"his own\", familiar color..The idea is that once you've been in someone's shoes, you're less likely to think badly of them later because your brain retains the feeling that you were that person..The creators of the Be Different laboratory hope to achieve similar results.\"By the end of the body swap experiment, people feel like they're in each other's arms,\" ​​says Arthur Pointe, the project's programmer..– To experience something like this is just great..A great way to implant in a person's brain the ability to empathize with another\".An experiment with a rubber pen whose skin color differs from that of a participant significantly reduces racial bias. In addition to awakening this ability, which scientists call \"empathy,\" the Be Different lab uses its technology in other situations where it can have a positive effect..The project's authors gave doctors the opportunity to swap bodies with patients to better understand physical ailments..And for people confined to a wheelchair - with dancers.Rick Frances Wahl says she'd happily swap bodies with someone again.\"I highly recommend this to everyone, everyone should try it,\" she says..“We all look at things differently, we have different feelings about the same things,” notes Arthur Pointo..- And it really is very much connected to our bodily experience..This kind of experience (offered by the Be Different Lab) will help us develop an understanding of how other people feel..And at the same time, better understand ourselves\".You can read the original of this article in English on the BBC Future website"}

Joint maneuvers that Washington and Seoul regularly conduct have just as regularly sparked outrage in Pyongyang.After the June summit, Trump agreed to cancel the exercises, which was seen as a goodwill gesture to Kim Jong-un.In his latest tweets, the president insists that his personal relationship with Kim remains very good and warm, and that there is no need to resume \"war games\" with the South..However, he adds, if they do resume, they will be more grandiose than ever before..U.S. and South Korean Marines Practice Joint Beach Landings Trump's tweets appeared to contradict remarks by his defense secretary, who said Tuesday that the suspension of some joint exercises was done in good faith and that there were no plans to suspend them further.Since the end of the Korean War, in which Washington and Seoul fought against the North's army, American troops have been permanently stationed in South Korea..According to an agreement concluded at the end of the war, 29 thousand troops are stationed in the south of the peninsula..US military personnel."}

That's why we condemn him.\".\"Keep in mind: we haven't forgotten how to plant! They think that Stalin is dead, and that means everything is possible! We'll wipe them out! For people like that, it won't be a thaw, or a freeze, but frost!\" (at a meeting with the creative intelligentsia on March 7, 1963).It is no coincidence that Nikita Sergeevich is called the most controversial of the Soviet leaders..His monument at the Novodevichy Cemetery was the work of the sculptor Ernst Neizvestny, who, by the way, was out of favor with him, and is made half of white and half of black marble..The BBC Russian Service publishes a selection of statements about Khrushchev, confirming the contradictory nature of his personality._________________________________________________________ Contemporaries and Descendants - about Khrushchev"}

There is no escape from this song during Christmas - it plays on the radio, in shopping malls, even in the elevator you can't hide from it.Apparently, the creator of the work touched some subtle string in the soul of humanity..\"I dream of Christmas,\" Bing Crosby sings in his beautiful baritone, \"like the old days, when the tree tops sparkled and the children listened to the sleigh bells in the snow.\".Behind the commercial powdered sugar that this song is generously sprinkled with, there is, I think, something real and sincere..The story behind the song is this: Irving Berlin spent the winter at the Californian resort of La Quinta, where the temperature on New Year's Eve does not drop below +20 degrees.There, in the tropical warmth, the lines about \"White Christmas\" were born..They appeared, apparently, from the subconscious..Irving Berlin, born Israel Beilin, was born in Tyumen to a synagogue cantor.Fleeing the pogroms, the family walked to the border and took a steamship to New York in 1893.Little Iza was five years old.As a boy he delivered newspapers, then he became a singing waiter.I learned to play the piano myself.I learned it crookedly – ​​I played only on the black keys and only in the unimaginable key of F sharp.He didn’t know how to read music, but he had outstanding intuition and flair..Vague memories of Tyumen winters (it's -18 there these days), romanticized in the annoying Californian heat, resulted in a song in 1940.From Algeria to Australia The song turned out to be, as they say, resonant.The majority of the world's population lives in the heat.North and South Africa, from Algeria and Morocco to Zimbabwe and Mozambique, with Swaziland thrown in.In South America – from Brazil to Honduras, from Mexico to Argentina.Let's also add here the entire southern United States..And in the east - Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.India, Iran, Laos, Malaysia.Iraq, Yemen, United Arab Emirates.Vietnam, Philippines and Pakistan.South of Japan, Lebanon, Israel.There are countries that are even hotter – Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama.Bolivia, Colombia.Australia, Caribbean.The list can go on and on..All these millions and billions of people have never seen \"White Christmas\" and therefore can only dream about it..And here's a song by the way.A few years ago, we found ourselves in the Virgin Islands for Christmas and New Years..There, Irving Berlin's dream also came true..In the main square of the town, in the thirty-degree heat, stood a magnificent Christmas tree (of course, nylon), decorated with exorbitant toys in the style of \"Alice in Wonderland\".The people of Tortola have never heard sleigh bells, thrown snowballs or made snowmen, but a vague dream of a winter snow-white shroud of virgin purity with which Nature covers all untidiness has somehow reached the local tropical latitudes..Seva and Olga, Virgin Islands Ice on the Thames Recently, British forecasters announced that this New Year will be the warmest in the last 130 years, with an average of +14 degrees.It's hotter than summer in Magadan.There won't be a white Christmas in Britain, it will be more like wet asphalt.I remember how, as a young navigator, I stood on the bridge with an English pilot.We were at anchor, waiting for the tide to go up the river..“We had a terribly harsh winter last year,” the pilot told me with feeling, “so many people died from the cold! You can’t imagine what kind of frosts there were.”...\" His face was distorted with agony, and he cried out with emotion: \"THE THAMES IS FROZEN!!!\" Of course, I sympathized politely, but to myself I thought - what's wrong with that? In my native Leningrad, the Neva froze every year - and nothing happened..Since that distant 1963, the Thames has not been covered with ice again.However, in the 17th-18th centuries this happened regularly..The English artist Abraham Hondius vividly and realistically depicted winter fairs on the Thames in his paintings at the end of the 17th century..There is a sled track, tents on the ice, and a crowd of happy boys....Where did it all go? This winter fair was documented in 1754 In 38 years of living in London I have seen snow ten times.Ice on rivers and lakes – never.The happy period of English life has come to an end, we said goodbye to London.We went to the Rhodope Mountains, we live at an altitude of 1525 meters next to a ski resort, so snow is guaranteed.If not from a cloud, then from a snow cannon.\"Kamin-TV\" We don't dream of \"White Christmas\", we just wait for it.With lights and jingling bells.Just like in childhood.The main show for me on such days is \"Kamin-TV\".Fire behind the fireplace glass like a TV show.Lighting a fireplace is an interactive activity: you need to bring it, light it, and rustle it.Then rake it out and take it out.I started to understand a lot about firewood.Spruce, pine, oak.There is also a local beech of extraordinary hardness..We collect dry brushwood in the forest for kindling.The area is vast.It takes skill and habit.I can arrange a whole symposium on this topic with knowledgeable people..My relatives from St. Petersburg are coming for Christmas, then we'll talk..Fire behind the fireplace glass as a TV show In conclusion, I congratulate you with all my heart in the words of Irving Berlin's song: May your days be merry and bright and may all your Christmases be white.\"May your days be joyful and bright, and your Christmas - white\".I would also like to thank the Russian \"Black Hundreds\" for the flourishing of American culture, which gave us this white dream for all times!"}

a base with a radar and another where it was planned to deploy anti-missiles.Along with NATO expansion, Moscow sees this program as a threat to Russian interests.However, before the Ukrainian crisis and the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia in the spring of 2014, the parties actively discussed problems in relations and even made compromises.Thus, in the fall of 2013, the US made a concession by curtailing the last phase of the European missile defense program, which was the one that most displeased Russia.However, after the annexation of Crimea and the worsening situation in eastern Ukraine, relations between the parties have deteriorated significantly..At that time, military cooperation between Russia and NATO was curtailed, and only diplomatic channels remained open..In early May, it became known that the US was launching a ground-based missile defense system in southern Romania, which will become part of the wider Aegis system..In the western direction, Russia in recent months has begun to deploy new forces and conduct exercises in the western operational direction, which the Baltic states have perceived as a sign of preparation for a possible invasion..In January 2016, it became known that Russia would create three new divisions in the Western Military District in addition to the 1st Tank Army, which was being created there..In Moscow, however, they insist that, firstly, this operational direction has been the least protected in recent years, and this situation simply needs to be corrected, and secondly, it now urgently needs to be strengthened even more precisely against the backdrop of the activity of NATO countries..Recently, incidents involving NATO and Russian air force aircraft have become more frequent.The most high-profile cases were the flight of Russian Su-24 bombers dangerously close to the destroyer USS Donald Cook in the Baltic Sea, as well as several incidents with American intelligence aircraft in the Far East and over the Baltic Sea..In the West, in recent months, there have been repeated statements that NATO forces are not prepared to contain Russia in the event of a conflict in the Baltic States, and various scenarios for the deployment of rapid reaction forces have been proposed..At the same time, there were also opinions that four battalions (rumors about such a solution to the problem had been circulating before) were only the bare minimum necessary..Meanwhile, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has repeatedly stated that he prefers to engage in dialogue with Russia, despite his firm position on Ukraine and Crimea.On May 20, he said he would seek to convene a meeting of the Russia-NATO Council at ambassadorial level before the alliance's summit in Warsaw..According to Stoltenberg, the Russia-NATO Council can be a good tool for preventing military incidents and risks."}

You left the polling station today and did what Putin allowed you to run for.On caviar and corporate events Navalny: You say: \"Let's unite!\" My people will then tell me: \"Goodbye!\" They will not want to work with a person who held corporate events for Gazprom, who advertised black caviar.Sobchak: You have changed over the years.Look how many times you repeated about black caviar.How much do you talk about hockey player Ovechkin's villa - although you know that he earned it himself.I had a modest campaign.And I earned it all myself..It's better to make money from corporate events than from boards of directors of shady companies.And regarding insults - aren't you ashamed of yourself? You showed vulgar clips with [CPRF presidential candidate Pavel] Grudinin.Why this pettiness? You are a brave man..On travel around the country Sobchak: I have traveled to more cities than any other candidate.We can say endlessly: \"You're lying - no, you're lying!\".I know what I said at your house then..I offered you to nominate your wife Yulia - you refused..We need to show people that we are united by a common goal..But people only see that we are arguing.And these people are worse off because Putin has seized power again..And today the majority really votes for him..So let's fight for these people together..We needed one candidate to get to television, and I did it..And I talked about corruption and the president personally..Navalny: Everything you just said is just empty words.They are about nothing.This is nonsense: it would be great if you could drink sea water without feeling sick.I am a person from real life.My problems are as follows: in my Kemerovo region, observers are being kicked out because you helped this happen..You and [presidential candidate Grigory] Yavlinsky revoked their directions.My problems are that my headquarters are searched every day..My chief of staff [Leonid] Volkov is under arrest..You, leaving the voting place, said that the people who are going on strike are to blame for your small percentage.On presidential ambitions Navalny: I will never be above this meanness.Sobchak: That's why you'll never become president.The Central Election Commission refused to register Alexei Navalny as a presidential candidate at the end of December last year..Navalny has announced a boycott of the presidential elections called \"Voters' Strike\".In January, a protest of the same name took place across Russia, attracting thousands of people.Ksenia Sobchak's nomination for the elections became known in September last year.She went against them under the slogan \"Against all\".Before this, Sobchak met with current President Vladimir Putin and discussed her nomination with him, but, according to her, she did not coordinate this step, but only notified him of such plans..According to Sobchak, Putin was unhappy.At the same time, many media outlets, citing anonymous sources, claimed that the idea to nominate Sobchak came from the Kremlin in order to distract attention from Navalny and his \"voter strike\" and increase turnout at the expense of people who do not want to support any of the candidates.."}

For us, this is another step into the future: we are starting production of a new classic - the Lada Granta,\" said the plant's general director, Alexey Alexeyev. However, the Izhevsk plant will continue to fulfill all its warranty obligations for the cars recently discontinued for 36 months. The plant will also continue to produce spare parts for these cars. The Lada-2104 car was produced at the Togliatti plant in 1984. Despite the fact that 8,000 cars of this model were sold in the first half of 2012, demand for it has continued to fall recently. AvtoVAZ management announced its plans to stop production of the Lada-2104 in July of this year, shortly after the end of production of another classic model, the \"seven\" (Lada-2107), which had been produced at the Togliatti plant since 1982. Subsequently, production of these two models was transferred to Izhevsk. Currently, classic Lada models continue to be assembled in Egypt at the Egypt-Lada plant. According to AvtoVAZ press service, 4,700 auto kits for the assembly of Lada-2107 cars were shipped to Egypt in the first eight months of 2012. No decision has been made yet to suspend the supply of components. \"New classic\" After stopping production of the \"four\", the Izhevsk plant will completely switch to a new model, the Lada Granta, equipped with an automatic transmission. All workers at the plant have already been transferred to new production lines. In addition, the enterprise switched to two-shift work, which led to a personnel shortage. The plant currently requires another 200 employees. As AvtoVAZ External Relations Director Igor Burenkov told the BBC Russian Service, there is already a \"surge of interest\" in the new model. \"This car is designed to replace the classic AvtoVAZ models. It is very different from them in quality, but will not be much more expensive in price, so we call it a \"new classic,\" Burenkov said. Manufacturers hope that motorists will be attracted by the low price of the new model, which will average 259 thousand rubles ($8,490). Lada Granta became the first Russian-made car with an automatic transmission. Attempts to produce cars with automatic transmission were made in Soviet times, but were unsuccessful, notes AvtoVAZ External Relations Director. According to the company, there are already queues for the new model in Russia. Lada Granta is also intended to be supplied to the CIS countries. If you have photos of the classic Lada, send them to us using the email form."}

in addition to the owner's photo and last name, it contains a number in the unified demographic register..The inscriptions in Russian will disappear, and only those in Ukrainian and English will remain..In addition, a chip with the last name and first name, year of birth, gender, place of birth, fingerprints and identification code will be sewn into the card..The new document will be issued at local offices of the State Migration Service and administrative services centers at a price of 145 hryvnia..The newspaper notes that there are certain problems with issuing ID passports.For example, the function of registering them online is currently only available to residents of Dnipro and Ternopil; in Sumy there is no access to the unified demographic register..In Kyiv, not all administrative service centers are ready to issue cards: in the Goloseevsky CPA, journalists of the newspaper were told that they do not have the equipment, and were advised not to rush, because, allegedly, these passports will not be ratified in many countries.And the State Border Service confirmed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is indeed currently negotiating the ratification of the cards and advised that when traveling, for example to Belarus, just in case, take your passport with you, the newspaper reports..Subsidies only for the poor \"KP in Ukraine\" reminds that, according to preliminary calculations of the government, this year almost nine million families will receive compensation from the state for payment of housing and communal services.But, as the government believes, rich people should not use subsidies - for this purpose, a whole \"landing party\" of commissions will be sent to Ukrainians' apartments to assess the standard of living of applicants.\"If they see that everything is great, but a person asks for a subsidy for utilities and shows low income, there is a reason to cancel it,\" explains Minister of Social Policy Andrei Reva.\"The inspector had the most questions about the TV that my granddaughter gave me for my birthday..She asked about its cost, and I answered that I didn’t know, and all my money goes on medicine, and showed receipts from the pharmacy...\"They assigned me a subsidy,\" says pensioner from Nikolaev Lidiya Dmitrievna.\"There is only one reason for refusing a subsidy - a one-time purchase of 50 thousand.UAH for the last 12 months from the moment of applying for a subsidy,\" explains lawyer Mikhail Yumashev..The newspaper inquired about the rights of the social services inspectorate and whether the inspector can look into the refrigerator or the cupboard..\"The inspection of property and housing conditions takes place with the consent of the applicant.This is not a search..Theoretically, you may be asked to open the closet, but it is unclear for what purpose: in the form of the inspection report approved by the Ministry of Social Policy, there is no place to indicate the number of televisions and the presence of fur coats, but there is a column where the number of pigs and other animals in the household is assessed,” explains lawyer Andrei Vigirinsky..BBC Monitoring Service."}

{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content in one sentence..The Fight Against the Islamic State: Who's Fighting Who?\nThe US Is Fighting the Islamic State From the Air That's actually a good question, and a big problem, given that the US is trying to translate significant tactical efforts on multiple fronts into one workable long-term strategy.As we approach the one-year anniversary of the US-led international campaign to \"weaken and ultimately destroy\" ISIS, questions remain about how effective the coalition has been..Former CIA Deputy Director John McLaughlin compared the current situation in the Middle East to the Thirty Years' War in Europe, a series of conflicts that escalated into a larger, more destructive war that significantly reshaped Europe, at the recent Aspen Security Forum..There are major conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Libya involving Sunnis, Shiites, Persians, Arabs, regimes, militants, reformers and traditionalists, McLaughlin said..In one form or another, they all shoot at each other..The constant flows of refugees and displaced people challenge not only the resilience of states in a given conflict, but also the populations and ultimately the policies of neighboring countries such as Lebanon, Jordan and Türkiye..The Thirty Years' War in Europe in the 17th century has parallels with the conflict in the Middle East. Over the past year, the United States has assembled a coalition of 62 countries to fight the one common denominator in all these conflicts and players - the \"Islamic State\".The advantage is that ISIS now controls about 25% less territory than it did a year ago..By now, ISIS has seen far more victories than defeats..Changing this ratio is the key to victory over the group..On the negative side, the US has yet to achieve what the military calls synergy - the key to success..One reason is the complex mix of \"enemies of the enemy\" in this conflict: Saudi Arabia, Iran, the Nusra Front, Hezbollah, Bashar al-Assad and the Kurdish People's Protection Units are all fighting the Islamic State..But their presence and conflicting goals currently make a comprehensive solution to the problem almost impossible to achieve..Many of these competing interests intersect in Turkey..Ankara wants Syrian rebels to defeat President Bashar al-Assad Türkiye and US agree to work more closely to protect Turkish-Syrian border.This is potentially important..The flow of fighters, money, supplies and oil across the Turkish border is causing serious concern.Türkiye is part of the camp that advocates solving the problem of Bashar al-Assad's stay in power first.Ankara believes that the civil war in Syria has a huge impact on the conflict.Until recently, Türkiye turned a blind eye to IS smuggling activities aimed at weakening the Assad regime.Ankara believes that the Islamic State is a secondary problem that will resolve itself with the fall of the Syrian regime..However, following recent ISIS attacks inside Turkey, the transitional government in Ankara (Türkiye is still trying to form a cabinet after the June elections) may reconsider this position..But even if Washington and Ankara are sailing on the same sea, they are not yet on the same wavelength..Turkey is convinced that a solution to the entire conflict cannot be achieved until Assad steps down. Shortly after Ankara and Washington announced new joint efforts against ISIS, Turkey carried out an attack on the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK.It included a strike on its Syrian ally, the People's Protection Units (YPG), one of the main forces in the fight against ISIS in northern Syria..The PKK is a recognized terrorist organization that has been waging a long-standing war against Turkey..Erdogan's government has held a series of on-again, off-again talks with the PKK in an attempt to end the conflict..Now they have been discontinued again..Turkish officials say they have reached an agreement with Washington to create a narrow \"safe zone\" that would allow the moderate opposition to make a presence in Syria..Ultimately, officials say, it could give internally displaced people in Syria and refugees beyond it, including nearly two million people in Turkey, some hope of returning home..The Obama administration has not yet announced whether such an agreement exists..Türkiye has long pressed the United States to provide air cover for a safe zone in Syria as a measure to increase pressure on the Assad government..Ankara is convinced that a solution to the entire conflict cannot be achieved until Assad steps down..Many Kurds blame Turkey for the Suruç bombings The US, while acknowledging that Assad is a major part of the problem, has yet to see a viable political path to resolving the issue - which would require the consent of Iran and Russia, which continue to support Assad.Washington is still considering the idea of ​​a security zone, but the conditions for this have not yet been created.Air support for the moderate opposition could also mean air protection for al-Nusra or Hezbollah - enemies of the enemy that America still considers adversaries..This is one of the reasons why the Obama administration is primarily focused on Iraq..Even with Iran's presence on the front lines, the existing order of war there is much clearer..In practice, although the US has set up a training and education program for the moderate opposition, the percentage of graduates is so modest that it will take months, if not years, to make a real contribution..Unfortunately, most likely there is still time..If the analogy with the Thirty Years' War is correct, this tangled Middle East conflict is still far from resolved..Philip J.Crowley, a former U.S. deputy secretary of state, now teaches at the George Washington University's Institute for Public Diplomacy and Global Communications.."}
