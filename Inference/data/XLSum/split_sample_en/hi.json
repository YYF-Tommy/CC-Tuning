Experiments on rats and humans showed that this bacteria in the stomach eats up creatine.This turns crenitine into gas, then it goes to the liver and gets converted into a chemical called 'TAMO'.This study showed that 'TAMO' was related to the accumulation of fat in blood vessels.This can increase the risk of heart diseases and may even lead to death.\"TAMO is often overlooked,\" says Dr. Hazen of the Cleveland Clinic.It might be useless.But it significantly affects cholesterol metabolism.It may increase cholesterol levels.Pulses, fruits, vegetables, whole grains and unsaturated fats are considered the basis of a healthy life. He says, \"Studies show that it is better to eat less red meat.\".I used to eat red meat five days a week.But now I have reduced it to once in two weeks or even less.'' He said that the results of the study have strengthened the fact that probiotic curd should be consumed to change the balance of bacteria in the stomach..Vegetarians naturally have more bacteria than non-vegetarians that are capable of breaking down carnitine into smaller fragments..Victoria Taylor, senior dietitian at the British Heart Foundation, said: \"This is certainly an interesting finding, highlighting the impact that red meat can have on the heart.\".'' However, some experts have a different opinion.\"It's a very solid argument,\" says Catherine Collins, a dietitian at St George's Hospital.But we know that eating some red meat once a week does not pose any risk to the heart..\"This doesn't require us to change our dietary recommendations,\" she says..Moderate consumption of meat, fish, dairy products and alcohol, pulses, fruit, vegetables, whole grains and unsaturated fats are still the keys to health and healthy living.''"}

But despite all the cost and preparation, the show is not receiving much praise, directed by British director Matthew Warches. The New York Times wrote that \"much of the play is incomprehensible\" while the Telegraph said that \"it is hard to bear.\" The musical is an abbreviated version of JR Tolkien's magnum opus and the director has faced many obstacles in preparing it. After the preview date of the play was announced, it had to be postponed for two days and a lot of cuts were made to condense it into a four-hour duration. Because a stage of the appropriate size for the play was not available in London, it was decided to first perform it in Toronto. The play will be performed at London's Dominion Theatre from next year. Technology There are a total of 55 characters in this play, 17 lifts are needed for its staging, there are many difficult scenes of fights etc. Director Warches says, \"It is like doing ten stage shows simultaneously.\" He says, \"Many scenes in it have been shown at a very high height, at many places the floor of the stage rotates, many such techniques have been used in it which have never been seen on stage.\" Despite all this, the art critic of the New York Times is not impressed, he wrote that after the show is over, there will be no one who will not come out with \"a headache, blurred vision and ringing in the ears.\" Maybe this review is a bit too harsh because many people who came out after watching the first day's show were heard saying in TV programs that it was a great presentation. But overall it can be said that the 25 million dollars and four years of hard work do not seem to be yielding favorable results."}

I think not...It is the result of the tradition of realistic and spontaneous acting that started with Motilal and was strengthened by actors like Balraj Sahni, Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri and Raghuveer Yadav.I remember Babuji took me along to show me 'Jaagte Raho'.He was fulfilling my wish.I became addicted to watching anything moving on the cinema screen.It seemed as if the magic on screen would never end..This magic was broken for the first time in 'Jaagte Raho'.There is an incident in 'Jaagte Raho', when our hero Raj Kapoor is wandering from door to door in search of water.she is thirsty.He gets a character.He takes out a small bottle from his kurta pocket and drinks liquor from it and sings a song.He was Motilal.When Babuji came home, he praised Motilal's acting with one word which remained in his memory forever - 'spontaneity'.When I grew up a little, I was impressed by Amitabh Bachchan's charisma.There was a different kind of ease in them.There was a charm in his ease in tense, romantic and humorous scenes.The desire to become an actor started growing in my mind.There was no way out.Then I read an interview of Naseeruddin Shah in the Hindi magazine 'Ravivar' published from Kolkata..In that he had mentioned the National School of Drama.I felt that if I wanted to become an actor, then Naseeruddin Shah's path was right and for that I would have to go to the National School of Drama.I have come to Delhi.I did not get admission there but Delhi introduced me to the world of Hindi films, which I was deprived of.I watched films of actors like Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri.It was understood that to become an artist, one should have the ease of Motilal and Naseeruddin with Amitabh Bachchan.Along with my friends, I would repeatedly return from watching films of theatre artists and would repeatedly try to understand the minute details of their acting.I kept trying to get into the depth of my friends' acting.I was frustrated by my inability to quickly achieve the ease of acting.During those days I met an actor Raghuveer Yadav.He was a big name in Delhi theatre..The seniors used to praise him and the juniors wanted to act like him.I got a chance to work with him.Raghuveer Yadav had everything that an actor should have – spontaneity, the ability to entertain the audience for two hours and the power to explain the character in the same two hours..There were three or four actors whom I kept trying to capture and assimilate.I kept trying to understand his acting process.that process is still ongoing.I learn from the actors around me.I always think he is a better actor than me..Be it Irrfan Khan, Aditya Srivastava, Vijay Raj or Rajpal Yadav.Till date, my endeavour is to adopt the good qualities of all these good actors.The crop of success that the actors of our generation are reaping today has been sown and nurtured by artists like Motilal to Raghuvir Yadav with tireless hard work and patience and has been protected from pests.Not just the film industry, but the audience too has accepted actors like us.This is a new trend that all actors are trying to understand the character.I ask for the full script.This change is important.It becomes necessary for all of us actors to stand up and salute all those natural actors of the realistic tradition, thanks to whom we all get respect, position, money, work today...Salute to the audience too that they have started appreciating our hard work.The smell of the sweat shed to live up to the character has also started to reach them."}

According to this report titled 'Will air strikes be effective', such attacks on Iran are not capable of completely destroying its nuclear program, rather such attacks can make Iran produce nuclear weapons more rapidly. The report of the Oxford Research Group has come at a time when two aircraft carriers of the US Navy have been deployed in the Gulf region and the US spokesperson has said that the possibility of military action against Iran cannot be ruled out. The report of this group also says the same thing that experts of air strikes have been saying for some time. According to the report, destroying Iran's nuclear bases is not as easy as America thinks. For this, many targets will have to be targeted simultaneously and even after that it will be difficult to say that the results will be as expected. There is also a possibility that there may be such bases in Iran about which the American intelligence services are not aware. This report has not been written by any military expert but by renowned nuclear scientist and peace advocate Frank Barnaby, which basically depicts the situation after a possible US attack on Iran. The report raises questions on the morality of the US action and says that Iran's nuclear program was started years ago under US policies. According to the report, if the US attacks, Iran can prepare nuclear weapons in months instead of years, although it is not clear how much enriched uranium Iran has for nuclear weapons. The amount of uranium is based on the fact how much progress Iran's nuclear program has made. The foreword to this report has been written by Hans Blix, former head of the United Nations Atomic Energy Agency. The report emphasizes on the fact that it will take years to take Iran's current nuclear program to nuclear weapons and diplomacy can still be used."}

What kind of problems arise in arresting a person from another state.Regarding this, Ramachandran explains, \"When a person from another state commits a crime, it is very difficult to arrest him.Even if their faces are seen in surveillance cameras or the police get their pictures, it is not easy to catch them because the local people are not able to recognize the faces of these outsiders so easily..'' \"Even if we cross all the hurdles and try to catch them by going to their home state, there is no guarantee of their arrest.'' It is difficult to arrest Ramachandran recalls an incident that happened to him in this regard, '' In the year 2014, a worker who came from Rajasthan to work was employed by a goldsmith in Coimbatore district, but that man killed the goldsmith and ran away after stealing two kilograms of gold.After a lot of effort we found that man in Barmer district.'' ''When an officer of Rajasthan police involved in the investigation entered the man's house with our team, the villagers accused the police officer of entering the house of a single woman.In such a situation, we had no other option but to return from there..The man has not been arrested yet.Ramachandran recalls another incident and says that if a person from another state is involved in a crime, he returns immediately after committing the crime.\"A person coming from North India travels to Tamil Nadu by air,\" says Ramachandran..To avoid getting caught, he pays for his air tickets in cash only and never uses credit card, debit card or net banking..“After reaching the airport, he books a cab for a particular destination,” he says.But on the way, he complains of feeling unwell and asks the cab to take him to the nearest hospital.Usually he chooses the afternoon time, because at that time the doctors are not with the patients.'' ''In big hospitals, ward boys or nurses do not recognize all the doctors.The man who came in the cab reaches the OPD ward and wearing a stethoscope sends the ward staff out of the ward to get some documents.Once the ward staff leaves, they will approach the female patient who is wearing any jewellery.Then he would take off her jewelry while pretending to inspect her.'' ''After this, he will ask the patient to lie face down and then he will run away with the jewellery.“Usually, migrant workers who have been living in other states for a long time commit a crime only when they get involved in a fight among themselves,” Ramachandran concludes..Crimes that are planned are very rare.Therefore, everyone should not be suspected for committing these crimes and North Indians living in South India should not be looked at with the same eyes..''

Bhawanipur's Pooja will probably never be able to forget the night of 23 July, when the water of the Gandak river entered her house at midnight..Speaking to the BBC, she says, \"It was after 11 p.m..We were all asleep when suddenly someone familiar called home and informed us that the embankment of the river had broken.We were all scared.But before we could understand anything and decide what we should carry and where we should go, water had entered our houses..The river didn't even give me 30 minutes.Had to leave home due to flood.only life saved.\" The first three days after the embankment broke were tragic for the villagers.When Mamata Devi of Bhawanipur remembers those days, helplessness and anger come on her face.During the conversation, his eyes welled up with tears.In a trembling voice she says, \"This tarpaulin that you are seeing, we got it after three days.For the first three days, no one came from the administration.The river was in spate, our houses were flooded, water was falling from above continuously and the strong wind did not stop.'' ''We spent the first few days soaking wet in just one pair of clothes.Later, the government people gave a tarpaulin, two kilos of chuda, half a kilo of gram and half a kilo of sugar.no one has come since then.How many days can a person survive on two kilos of chuda (churna)?\" The government compensation of Rs. 6000 was not even received.

Kim Jong-un, who was cut off from the outside world for years, has now emerged as a powerful player.Meetings with Kim Jong-un have been scheduled this year for the leaders of China, Russia, Syria, South Korea and the United States.Many big leaders really want to meet him.Russian President Vladimir Putin has invited Kim Jong-un to meet in Vladivostok (a city bordering China) in September.While Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has even said that he would like to visit North Korea's capital, Pyongyang.Jean Lee, a former bureau chief for the Associated Press news agency in Pyongyang, said the world was watching Kim Jong-Un become an international statesman..We are all witnesses to this.North Korea's confidence He said: \"This show is a far cry from 2010, when Kim Jong-un was seen as a child-like heir apparent.But now his confidence is at a different level.They have ballistic missiles and Kim does not consider himself any less powerful than the rest of the world's nuclear powers, such as the US..\"Ken Gauze, author of the book North Korea's House of Cards, writes in his latest essay that Kim Jong-un may have expected such results when he accelerated his missile testing program in 2017.\".However, there is also a view that Kim Jong-un had very little idea that after the missile test program, he would get a chance to have a summit with US President Donald Trump.\"Kim has isolated himself from the outside world for a very long time,\" says Jean Lee, a new diplomatic operative..This is one reason why foreign officials from around the world do not want to miss the opportunity to meet him, because they want to know about Kim Jong-un.They want to understand what Kim wants for his country.\" There are two other things that have helped Kim Jong-un define his new diplomatic boundaries.For example, South Korea elected a liberal president who promised during his campaign that he would try to improve relations with North Korea.This helped the two countries to communicate and establish their relationship.After this came the invitation from US President Donald Trump.However, the previous Commander in Chief had said that he would go ahead with the summit only after certain conditions were met.North Korea changed its goals but Donald Trump, who had been threatening North Korea for a year, agreed to a face-to-face meeting without any conditions.When Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump meet in Singapore, it will be worth remembering how Kim Jong-un, who was internationally isolated till six months ago, will be among the two leaders who will be at the center of one of the biggest political developments in the world.Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un will meet at the luxury Capelle Hotel on Sentosa Island. This summit has given a political advantage to Kim Jong-Un himself.This new diplomatic strategy is not based only on power, but also arises from many needs.Announcing that his nuclear programme is now complete, Kim Jong-un said that now his entire focus will be on the country's economy.And to do that, he'll need to build alliances and find old friends.In such a situation, China is most important for Kim Jong-un as far as relations between China and North Korea are concerned.It has been North Korea's main trading partner.Kim has met the Chinese President twice in the recent past.Both times the main topic of discussion was trade.China wants that if North Korea is cancelling its nuclear program, then the sanctions imposed on it should also be lifted, so that the economy of North Korea can be stabilized..Also, to remain confident in front of America, Kim Jong-un needs to be able to say that China stands with him.Kim also met South Korean President Moon Jae-in.Both discussed the future of the Korean Peninsula.But what stood out the most was Kim Jong-un's cheerful attitude.Looking at him, it felt like he wanted to communicate and improve relationships, which was never felt looking at his father and grandfather.Relations between Russia and Syria are also similar. In more than a decade, a senior Russian diplomat visited North Korea for the first time..However, Donald Trump seemed a little upset with North Korea's meeting with Russian diplomats.Kim Jong-un wants to show that North Korea is not surrounded in any way.North Korea is connected to Russia by border.He can talk to them for his financial interests..That's why he wants to communicate with them as well..Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on his visit to North Korea. There are hidden messages for America in all these things and somewhere North Korea is also trying to say that it is not under any pressure.At the same time, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's relations with North Korea are a matter of concern for the United Nations as well as the United States..North Korea's state news agency has said that President Bashar al-Assad is ready to visit North Korea soon.Syria is an old ally of North Korea.Both countries have diplomatic relations since 1966.North Korea also supplied arms to Syria during the Arab-Israeli War in October 1973.A leaked UN report in February also alleged that North Korea supplied Syria with suspected materials that could be used to make biological weapons between 2012 and 2017..In such a situation, the international community will now keep a closer eye on the relations between these two countries..These things are under observation but it is not as if everything has been in North Korea's favour during this time.There came a time when there was talk of cancelling the summit due to the comments of North Korea's Deputy Foreign Minister on US Vice President Mike Pence.Then Kim Jong-un's team made every effort to bring things back on track.However, Kim Jong-un has changed the rules of the game.The nuclear arsenal which was becoming a major liability for North Korea till last year, has now been turned into a diplomatic weapon by North Korea.But what will be North Korea's end game? And what is to happen after the summit between North Korea and the US?

Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan believed they were a measure of income available for spending.Journalist Robert Krulwich had already heard of Greenspan's theory 20 years ago.He told BBC Radio that the idea remains fascinating among economists.But the fashion for low-slung jeans may change men's shopping habits.Pockets and Underpants Recalling a discussion with Greenspan in his office on the issue of the economy, Krulwich says, \"He said that the economy could be predicted by men's underpants.The sale of underpants can predict what is going to happen in the economy.“When a man becomes an adult, he will buy a pair of underpants, wear them, and then buy another pair,” Krulwich explains..This trend probably won't change much.But it changes under certain circumstances.There comes a time when the sale of underwear starts decreasing.This shows that the man in that house is going to cut down on his expenses..\" \"He's really trying not to spend on one of his clothes and it doesn't really matter.Because the underwear can only be seen by those who have access to where it is kept and they won't care about it.Since it is a personal matter, even the wife will not be affected.\" Fashion changes \" Krulwich says Greenspan was using a 1970s model to reach this conclusion.It said that men often lend money to other family members to meet their clothing needs.But he doesn't spend this money on himself..\"Men's underwear fashion has changed a lot since then,\" admits Krulwich..\"Who knew that with the changing times, people would wear their pants that would slide down to show off their six-packs and the brand of underwear would be known,\" says Krulwich..Calvin Klein will be a name people will look up to.“When men are shopping for themselves, that's extra spending money, and they'll keep wearing their pants for as long as they're still worth it,” says Jen Garner, founder of Dead Good Undies..Garner said recent sales reflect the ups and downs of recessions in past years.She says that in 2011, 54 thousand panties were sold at her shop whereas in 2012 this figure fell to 50 thousand.Garner sees this as an achievement in the face of difficult business conditions.Garner adds, \"I don't think that theory really works that well these days.\".Men who shop online are taking control of their budgets with their choices.”"}

Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq has said that he is eager to know what Pervez Musharraf thinks about the future of the Indo-Pak peace process. He also said that he also wants to talk to Musharraf about his promise that the talks on Kashmir should be trilateral and Kashmiris should also be included in it. Earlier, after meeting Kashmiri leaders, Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz had said that Kashmiri leaders should also be included in the Indo-Pak peace talks. It is noteworthy that nine separatist leaders from India-controlled Kashmir had gone on a historic tour of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir last week and later also visited the capital Islamabad and other cities of Pakistan. This is the first time in the history of nearly six decades after the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947 that some leaders from Indian administered Kashmir have gone to Pakistan administered Kashmir on an official visit. Mirwaiz Umar Farooq is leading a team of seven leaders of the moderate faction of Hurriyat, which includes Abdul Ghani Butt, Maulana Abbas Ansari and Bilal Lone. Apart from these, JKLF leader Yasin Malik and Democratic Freedom Party leader Mohammad Abdullah Tari are also visiting. Kashmiri leaders had met Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz in Islamabad on Sunday. But Yasin Malik did not go to meet Aziz with other leaders and he met Shaukat Aziz separately the next day. Kashmiri separatist leaders have gone to Pakistan on the invitation of the Pakistan government. But Syed Ali Shah Gilani, leader of the hardline faction of Hurriyat Conference, rejected the invitation. Meanwhile, Democratic Freedom Party leader Shabir Shah wanted to go but he had written his nationality as Kashmiri in the travel form due to which he could not be given the permit."}

Observers also believe that Pakistan is trying to reduce tensions on its eastern border, where the recent bitterness in India-Pak relations has increased, while on its western border with Afghanistan, tensions should not increase. This is Zardari's first visit to Afghanistan after assuming the post of President of Pakistan. In the talks with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, measures to counter Islamic extremism in both the countries are likely to be discussed. Earlier, Afghan President Karzai has accused Pakistan of not taking adequate steps to stop attacks on Afghan and NATO forces by Taliban insurgents present in the Pakistani border area. In the last few weeks, Taliban fighters had attacked NATO supply depots in north-western Pakistan and set fire to several trucks that were carrying supplies for foreign forces in Afghanistan. Accusations and counter-accusations According to senior journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai, \"America does not want Pakistan to withdraw its troops from its western border because tensions between India and Pakistan have increased significantly. On the other hand, Afghanistan wants Pakistan to take adequate steps against the Taliban. Therefore, in this tense atmosphere, Pakistan does not want tensions to increase on the Pak-Afghan border as well.\" It is worth mentioning that according to Pakistan's state TV channel PTV, the Pakistan government summoned the Indian Deputy High Commissioner in Islamabad and expressed concern over the recent entry of an Indian Air Force fighter plane into its border and sought an explanation. On the other hand, the Indian Foreign Ministry denied this in a statement and said that a detailed reply will be given to Pakistan in this regard."}

The game of Rupee and Dollar can be understood in this way.For example, if we are doing some business with the US.America has 67,000 rupees and we have 1000 dollars.The price of dollar is Rs. 67, so both of them currently have equal amount of money.Now if we want to import something from America to India, which costs Rs. 6,700 in our currency, then we will have to pay $100 for it..Now our foreign exchange reserves are left with 900 dollars and America has Rs 73,700.According to this, not only the 67,000 rupees of India that were in the US foreign exchange reserves, but the 100 dollars that were in India's foreign exchange reserves also reached it..In this case, India's position can improve only if India sells goods worth $100 to America....that isn’t happening right now.That means we import more and export less.Currency expert S Subramaniam explains that in such situations, the Reserve Bank of India ensures adequate supply of dollars in the market by purchasing dollars from its reserves and from abroad..How is the movement of the rupee decided? Currency expert S Subramaniam says that the value of the rupee depends entirely on its demand and supply.Import and export also affect it.Every country has reserves of the foreign currency in which it transacts.The movement of the currency of a country is determined by the increase or decrease in its foreign exchange reserves..The US dollar has the status of a global currency and most countries pay their import bills in dollars only..Why is the rupee weak? The reasons for the rupee's inability to hold its ground against the dollar in the current environment vary with time.Sometimes it becomes a victim of economic conditions, sometimes of political conditions and sometimes of both..Asif Iqbal, Research Head in a Delhi based brokerage firm, believes that there are many reasons for the weakening of the rupee in the current situation. The first reason is the rising oil prices - The biggest reason for the continuous weakening of the rupee is the rising prices of crude oil..India is one of the largest importers of crude oil.Crude oil prices are at a three-and-a-half-year high and have reached around $75 a barrel.India imports a lot of oil and has to pay its bill in dollars..Selling by foreign institutional investors- Foreign institutional investors have sold heavily in the Indian stock markets.So far this year, foreign institutional investors have sold shares worth more than Rs 46,197 crore.Income from bonds increased in America – Now American investors are withdrawing their investments from India and taking them to their country and investing in bonds there.What will be the effect if the rupee falls? The question is that if the rupee continues to fall like this against the dollar, what will be the effect on our health.According to currency expert Subramaniam, the biggest impact will be that inflation may increase.If the import of crude oil becomes expensive then inflation will also increase.If transportation becomes expensive then vegetables and food items will become expensive.Apart from this, payment in dollars will also be heavy.Apart from this, travelling abroad will become expensive and education of children abroad will also become expensive.Who benefits from the weakening of the rupee? Does anyone in India benefit from the weakening of the rupee? Subramaniam says in response to this.“Yes, absolutely.This is a simple rule, where there is some loss, there is also some benefit.Exporters will have a great time....They will receive payment in dollars and then they will redeem it in rupees and benefit from it.\" Apart from this, IT and pharma companies which sell their goods abroad will get benefit.10 countries where Indian Rupee is a heavy weight Why doesn't the world's third richest man invest money in India?

On Tuesday, when the Eurostar line started from Paris, many journalists and VIPs were on board and in London, this line stopped at St. Pancras station for the first time instead of Waterloo station. This train left Paris at 9:44 am British time and the Eurostar line covered the distance to London in two hours, three minutes and 39 seconds. The new Eurostar line will start operating for passengers from November 14.

BBC correspondent Nick Higham was also on board this Eurostar line and he says that the GPS instrument recorded the speed of this line as 202 miles i.e. about 323 kilometers per hour in France and 195 miles per hour in Britain. Eurostar trains often travel at speeds of up to 186 miles per hour in Britain. Ben Roose of London & Continental Railways, the company responsible for the new line, said: \"This is a real milestone in the history of rail transport in Britain. It is a great example of rail power and high quality engineering.\" Eurostar trains have been running at high speeds in French territory, but when they enter British territory they have to slow down because the railway lines in Britain are not strong enough and they are also used by normal trains in and out of London.

He is with the Pakistan team in England and has a say in important decisions..According to Geo TV report, Sarfraz and Mickey Arthur do not have the strength to control Inzamam.It is being said in the Pakistani media that the situation today is similar to what it was in 2006-07 when Inzamam-ul-Haq was the captain of the Pakistan team.A former official of the Pakistan Cricket Board told the Pakistani newspaper The News that when he was the captain, not only did he have control over the entire team, but every decision was also according to his wishes..It is being said in the Pakistani media that people are unhappy with the players included in Pakistan's playing eleven for the World Cup.This team also includes Inzamam-ul-Haq's nephew Imam-ul-Haq who failed miserably against India.After the 89-run loss to India, the official told The News, \"Inzamam is a domineering man.They are autocratic and stubborn about their likes and dislikes.When Shahryar Khan was the chairman of the board, Inzamam had the last word in PCB.It seems like history is repeating itself once again.''

The video posted everywhere is so blurry that after watching it, it will seem that Priyanka Gandhi has dark circles under her eyes..This video has been shared hundreds of times from several major Facebook pages and groups, including 'I am with Yogi Adityanath', 'Rajput Sena' and 'Modi Mission 2019'.People have shared videos in all these groups and claimed that Priyanka Gandhi misbehaved with media persons under the influence of alcohol.But in our investigation, we have found all these claims to be false..When Priyanka's anger burst out...Reverse image search shows the video is from Thursday, April 12, 2018.On the evening of 12 April, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had appealed to his followers on social media to join the 'Midnight Protest' at India Gate in Delhi against the Kathua and Unnao rape cases..In January 2018, a minor girl from the Bakarwal community was gang-raped and murdered in Jammu's Kathua district.A few days before this incident, BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar was accused of allegedly raping a minor girl in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh..Both the cases had gained a lot of attention and there were protests all over the country regarding these..In the same sequence, Rahul Gandhi's younger sister Priyanka Gandhi had joined the protest on April 12 in Delhi along with her daughter Miraya and husband Robert Vadra..The main slogan of this protest was- 'Remove Modi, save the country'.With both Rahul and Priyanka joining this protest, there was a competition among Congress workers to reach close to their leaders and Priyanka Gandhi herself had a lot of difficulty in reaching the main protest site adjacent to India Gate..According to some reports, Priyanka Gandhi was angry about the jostling that happened with her and her daughter Miraya.Reaching the main protest site, he told party workers and media persons, \"Think once what you are doing.Now you will stand quietly and walk over there..Those who want to push should go home.\" According to all the reports of 12-13 April 2018, it is correct to say that Priyanka Gandhi was angry at the media persons and party workers, but there is no mention of her being 'intoxicated' in any report..Ever since Priyanka Gandhi was formally appointed as the general secretary of the Congress party, propaganda material against her is being shared rapidly in right-wing leaning groups..Many people have posted this old video of Priyanka Gandhi on social media linking it to the controversial comment of BJP leader Subramanian Swamy..Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy had said, \"Priyanka Gandhi is suffering from bipolar disorder.She behaves quite violently.Therefore they should not work in public life.\" Read other stories of 'Fact Check': (For BBC Hindi's Android app you can click here.You can also follow us on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram and YouTube.)"}
{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content in one sentence.\n\nArticle 370: BJP has timely captured the public sentiment on 370 - Opinion\n\nWith his clear and articulate arguments, the Home Minister has put to rest the speculations and confusions that have been going on for the past few days and the prevailing confusion and apprehensions among the media, social media and commentators about the situation in Kashmir.Elections have consequences and the ruling party of India, BJP, has always had a clear intention to remove Article 370 which according to Jana Sangh ideologue Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya, was an article that prevented the people of the state of Kashmir from feeling national and emotional unity..After 72 years of independence, public sentiment on a large scale is in favor of the removal of Article 370 which breeds separatism in the hearts and minds of the people.One by one all the political parties (except a few) which were in opposition to the establishment, keeping aside their political differences, supported the government.The Aam Aadmi Party, which has often protested against the lieutenant governor demanding full statehood, said it too supported the government's decision to crush terrorism and maintain the territorial integrity of the country..For a common Indian, the debate in the Parliament on this historic day was clearly highlighting which political party was standing on which camp and it can be said that the public was weighing everyone..What did Kashmiri Pandits say on the abolition of Article 370? What will change in Kashmir after the removal of 370, what is the current situation? A thorn in the path Congress Chief Whip Bhubaneswar Kalita resigned from the Rajya Sabha saying that the opposition by Congress to the removal of this article is against national sentiment and suicidal.For too long, Jammu and Kashmir has been presented as a dispute or a problem – the entire narrative has been full of high-sounding and controversial rhetoric, ignoring how an issue of just seven percent of land has been blown out of proportion into a full-fledged state.The Indian Independence Act, 1947 does not refer to the independence of any part of British India but talks about the formation of two separate and independent territories, India and Pakistan, which will be composed of the territories and people of British India and the Princely States..Maharaja Hari Singh, who played an active role in all pre-independence discussions, never made any claim for independence.Four members from Jammu and Kashmir participated in the Constituent Assembly discussions and like other rulers, Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Indian Constitution..Article 370 has long been a thorn in the way of Indian unity and the integral integration of Kashmir with India.This 'special status' has done little to improve the situation in the Valley and has only served to drag down other parts of the state - Jammu and Ladakh.Kashmir: Article 370 ends, what will change? Kashmir: Towards a solution or towards a new problem? Distinction The Kashmir 'problem' has overshadowed all talk of development and rights in the state and has been used by the rulers in Srinagar to hold the Centre captive to their demands.As Amit Shah said in Parliament, the future of the valley has been decided by only three families, in the process of which they themselves have been enriched but the common people have been kept away from the benefits..According to a financial analysis done in 2016, Jammu and Kashmir received 10% of the total central assistance given to states, while the share of the country's most populous state Uttar Pradesh was only 8% during the same period from 2000 to 2016..It has been 2%.While the assistance provided in Kashmir was Rs 91,300 per person, for Uttar Pradesh it was just Rs 4,300 per person.This imbalance cannot be explained by merely citing special circumstances, although the Central Accountant General has noted that relevant questions during audits were routinely left unanswered by the state government..On one hand, there have been financial irregularities in Jammu and Kashmir, on the other hand, discrimination has also been evident.A Kashmiri woman who marries outside the state had no inheritance and property rights.In the recent past, in April 2019 itself, the Valmiki community of Jammu had to file a petition in the court for equality.This struggle for rights has not found a place in the popular narrative and the majority sentiments regarding Kashmir remain limited to the Kashmir problem argument..Also, there is no resonance in the corridors of human rights on the expulsion of Kashmiri Pandits from the valley.Has India ignored UN resolutions on Kashmir issue? Article 370: Can the government's decision be challenged? BJP has timely tapped into public sentiment which is strongly in favour of repealing Article 370.That there has been a decline in terrorist activities in the last few years was also acknowledged by Ghulam Nabi Azad, who ironically was speaking against sending the army to Kashmir.It is clear that Article 370 did not help in stopping terrorism.Rather, it has fuelled discontent in the Valley, which has disproportionate control over the state's narrative.While it would be unfair to call this a mere populist move, the BJP and its predecessor Jana Sangh have been committed to scrapping Article 370 long before they were even in power, and that is what they have done.It is quite possible that this move will be challenged by the state parties as former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has said, but it is also certain that this step has been taken after careful consideration and legal advice and it will be adequately defended in the highest courts of the country..In the end it can be said that this was a step that was in demand for a long time and to take this step not only political will and courage but also tremendous determination was required..(Advaita is an author, screenwriter and columnist.(These are the personal views of the author) (For BBC Hindi's Android app you can click here.You can also follow us on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram and YouTube.)"}

LTTE chief Prabhakaran was killed in a conflict with the Sri Lankan army last month and the Sri Lankan army declared victory in the war against LTTE.

This story is not just about Kaya village and Panchvati.Children from many villages like Bundela, Bhatgaon, Sevar, Bartori adjoining Bilaspur city were tied in the bond of love on the day of Akshaya Tritiya.These Akshaya Tritiya weddings will continue till the end of April.In the name of Akshaya Tritiya, a large number of minor children were married today in the entire state of Chhattisgarh.A huge number of minor children are reported to have been married in Kawardha, the home district of the state's Chief Minister Raman Singh alone..Before this, on the day of Ramnavami, marriages of many young children had taken place in the state..However, the state government had claimed that strict arrangements have been made to prevent child marriages on the day of Akshaya Tritiya.But defying all claims, marriages of children below 18 years of age took place in many districts of the state including the capital Raipur..Child marriages were conducted on a large scale in remote areas of Bilaspur, Surguja, Kuria, Raigarh, Kawardha and Rajnandgaon.When government officials reached Ragda village near Chhuikhadan in Rajnandgaon, they found out that many children were getting married in the village..The villagers were adamant that these children were over 20 years old.\"This is a social problem,\" says Sunil Kujur, secretary of the state's women and child development department..Every effort has been made by the government to stop child marriage, but this work cannot be done like building construction..To stop this, society will have to take initiative\".On the day of Akshaya Tritiya, there is a tradition in Chhattisgarh that children play the game of marrying dolls..But declaring Akshaya Tritiya as an auspicious day and getting even minors and infants married is another horrifying aspect of this game..According to beliefs, on the day of Akshaya Tritiya, there is no need of a Pandit for finding the Muhurta, matching the Gunas, or even for getting the marriage done..Because of minimum rituals, less money is spent on weddings on this day.There is almost no demand for dowry in the marriage of small children..There is a religious belief that donating on this day gives virtue equivalent to seven lives and Kanya Daan is a great donation..Dr., President of Superstition Eradication Committee.Dinesh Mishra says, “Every year three and a half to four thousand child marriages take place in Chhattisgarh.Sometimes, children who are drinking milk from a bottle are married off.\".Last year, more than 30 cases of child marriage were reported on the day of Akshaya Tritiya in Bhaiyathan village of Surguja.There were many children among them who were lured with chocolates and made to sit in the wedding hall.Sharda Act: Sharda Act was enacted in 1928 to prevent child marriages..After that, in 1978, the Hindu Marriage Act and Child Marriage Act were amended and the marriage age of girls was fixed at 18 years and that of boys at 21 years..Provision of strict legal action on violation of Sharda Act has been made.Vinita Agarwal, a lawyer in the Chhattisgarh High Court, says, “The extent to which the Sharda Act is effective can be gauged from the child marriages that take place in almost every district of Chhattisgarh.”."}

For those of Mosul's nearly 2 million population who could not flee the city before the rebels took control, or for the few who returned home, life has improved somewhat..Residents say that when government forces were here, there were numerous checkpoints, temporary walls and barriers in the town, most of which have now been removed.This has made commuting in the city easier.There used to be bomb blasts and firing here all the time, now even those don’t happen..It is natural because rebels were behind these attacks.So, things have changed now.Looking at the traffic coming out of the city and going into the city indicates that the situation has become normal.It is a different matter that it appears so only on the surface..More vehicles are entering Mosul than leaving the city.Even the vehicles that are coming out are not packed with refugees.A man sitting in a car with women and children laughed and said, \"We have gone to meet the family.\" Concern about the future, he said, \" Apart from the general services, the situation is fine.it is safe.but people are worried.They don't know what will happen to Mosul.\" He said, \"They fear that the Iraqi army may try again to take it back.We fear shelling and air strikes.\" Most of the people coming from outside the city are complaining about shortage of water, electricity and petrol.The price of petrol has increased several times compared to the nearby Kurdish areas.Women say they are not being forced to wear burqa, although many women are doing so.All of them said that ISIS is not bothering them.But there are reports that ISIS has destroyed some of the city's rich cultural heritage.Reports of the destruction include the demolition of statues of renowned 19th-century musician Othman al-Mosuli and poet Abu Tammam, and the tomb of 12th-century historian Ibn al-Athir..The tomb of Prophet Noah appears to still be intact, although the government anticipated it would be demolished.So have these Sunni radicals really changed or is ISIS just trying to gain more time.Or could it be that this organization is trying to gain people's support so that it becomes difficult to remove it from there or isolate it?.\"Unlike the old al-Qaeda in Iraq under al-Zarqawi, these guys are emerging as protectors of the people against the tyrannical Shia regime in Baghdad,\" a senior Kurdish politician told AFP. \"They are handling the situation much better and that makes them more dangerous.\".It will be very difficult to turn the tribes against them.\" ISIS initially appeared to be quite moderate when it took control of the provincial capital of Raqqa in Syria.But later they drove away the other factions from there.After this ISIS imposed a strict Islamic rule.Their exploits include ban on music, strict dress code for women, provision of severe punishments like beheading, demolition of churches or any monument where they feel idol worship is taking place.It's no wonder many in Mosul are fearful about the future.The current peace may not last for very long.It is also hard to imagine that any future prospects will not involve even more upheaval.(Click here for BBC Hindi's Android app.You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter.)"}

{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content in one sentence.\n\nWhy is China angry with India's decision on Kashmir?\n\nOn August 5, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government abolished Article 370, which gave special status to the then state of Jammu and Kashmir.After this, a law was passed and the state was divided into two union territories.One of these union territories is Ladakh..China controls a part of it and claims the entire area.What was China's reaction? China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Khwa Chunying used strong words regarding India's decision.He said, \"China has always opposed the Indian acquisition of Chinese territory in the western sector of the China-India border..There has been no change in our firm and consistent position.\" By changing its laws, India has recently continued to ignore China's territorial sovereignty,\" Khwa Chunying added..This approach is not acceptable and will not be implemented.\" Has Modi changed the debate on Kashmir within Pakistan? Meanwhile in India, senior BJP leaders welcomed the move with nationalistic statements.Some leaders expressed hope that the part of the region which is under the control of China and Pakistan will also come to India..These leaders included the Chinese-controlled areas of Ladakh, Aksai Chin and Pakistan-administered Kashmir..India Today magazine quoted Union Minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Giriraj Singh as saying, \"I am 200 percent sure that PoK and Aksai Chin will also be reunited with the country very soon.\".Regarding Ladakh, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, \"The Indian government's announcement to make Ladakh (which includes Chinese territory) a union territory has challenged China's sovereignty and violated the agreement between the two countries to maintain peace and stability in the border area.\".On the Kashmir issue, Khwa Chunying said, \"China's position on the Kashmir issue is clear and consistent.There is also international agreement that the Kashmir issue between India and Pakistan is a long-standing issue..\" What is China's claim on Ladakh? China has been saying that the Ladakh region including Aksai Chin is part of a border dispute that is yet to be decided.Currently, China includes Aksai Chin in its Xinjiang region and considers it very important..The reason is that through this there can be movement of troops between Xinjiang and Tibet..China does not recognize the Shimla Agreement.This agreement was made in the year 1914 between Tibet and the British administration of India.In which Ladakh has been recognized as a part of India.China says that this treaty was not made with the then Chinese government and hence it is invalid.Wang Yi said, \"India's move is not acceptable to China and it will not change China's position on the sovereignty and administrative jurisdiction of this region..\"Indian Home Minister Amit Shah's strong claim that India wants to establish rule over northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region shows a sense of hostility towards China,\" the government-controlled Global Times wrote..\"China will counterattack strongly if India continues to press its unreasonable claims and provokes us with military action,\" the Global Times quoted Zhao Gancheng, a research fellow at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies, as saying..\" What does India have to say? India's Foreign Ministry has responded to China's criticism.\"Creation of new Union Territory of Ladakh is an internal matter of India,\" says MEA.\" India's Home Minister Amit Shah said in Parliament, \"The people of Ladakh have been demanding for a long time to give the region the status of a Union Territory, now they will be able to fulfill their aspirations.\" India has also been saying that China's claim on Aksai Chin is illegal and it is a violation of the Shimla Agreement..The dispute has been further complicated by China's close ally and India's rival Pakistan..Pakistan handed over a part of Trans Karakoram to China in the year 1963.This area is close to Aksai Chin.India calls Pakistan's move illegal.Reiterating India's long-standing stand on the issue, Shah said in Parliament, \"Kashmir is an inseparable part of India..there is no doubt about it.When I talk about Jammu and Kashmir, it also includes Pakistan Occupied Kashmir and Aksai Chin.\" What steps has China taken? China is implementing what it has said.At the request of Pakistan, the United Nations Security Council held a closed-door meeting.Pakistan has a dispute with India over Kashmir.Just a few days before this meeting, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar visited Beijing.According to the Global Times, he used conciliatory language, saying, \"Amending India's constitution will not create a new claim of sovereignty.\".This will not change the Line of Control in the Kashmir region (on the Pakistan border) and the Line of Control on the China-India border.\" Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir dispute for a long time.The United Nations meeting seems to be an effort in that direction.India opposes making this issue an international issue.But opinions were divided in this meeting.According to reports, Russia supported India.At the same time, Britain supported China in its demand that a public statement be issued after the meeting..Apart from China, the remaining four permanent members of the United Nations Security Council asked India and Pakistan to resolve their disputes bilaterally.Ultimately, this meeting ended without issuing any statement..However, China and Pakistan later issued statements on their behalf..After this, India also issued a statement and said that the statements of China and Pakistan do not reflect the views of the Security Council.India's statement was not refuted by any other member country.In the following days, most countries asked India and Pakistan to resolve their differences on Kashmir bilaterally.India should not take lightly China's statement on Jammu and Kashmir - View Indian Foreign Minister's visit to China, what was discussed?

It is noteworthy that 80 out of 400 prisoners kept in Guantanamo Bay detention centers will face military commissions. Defense lawyers say that they are studying this draft and trying to find out how much protection these new rules will provide to the prisoners. These rules state that evidence obtained through torture will not be valid and the evidence collected will be handed over to the judge and the prisoners will be able to study it.

Shoaib Akhtar is making extra efforts to improve his run up and maintain his strength, while Shabir Ahmed and Mohammad Sami are being kept under the strict supervision of coach Javed Miandad to bring back their rhythm. Though the team management is expressing that it has full faith in its bowlers, but seeing that the fast bowlers are not having any effect on the Indian middle order, their concern has definitely increased. The pitch of this match is also being considered a batsman's pitch where winning or losing the toss should not have any effect. Javed Miandad is not at all happy with the performance of Shahid Afridi, so a new opening batsman can be fielded in his place. On the other hand, the Indian team is playing with the same 12 players who played the last match. But in recent times, India's record in final matches has been very poor. But India's vice-captain Rahul Dravid says that India has lost the last four finals against Australia. He said that Pakistan's team is nothing compared to Australia, so India should have the upper hand.

The ball stopped on the pad of Shardul Thakur standing right in front of the middle stump and the umpire did not hesitate to raise his finger..With this, the players sitting in the Mumbai dugout ran into the field filled with enthusiasm and joy..On the other hand, there was disappointment in the Chennai camp.Harbhajan Singh stood up in anger with his pads on and bat in his hand but this moment was telling whether captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who changed the result of the match with his unique decision, made a mistake by sending Shardul Thakur to the field at the last moment.Cricket critic Vijay Lokpally believes that Dhoni has indeed made a big mistake.Harbhajan Singh is more known for hitting fours and sixes than Shardul Thakur.At the same time, another cricket critic Ayaz Memon believes that Dhoni may have taken this decision keeping in mind Shardul Thakur's batting in first-class cricket.It would have been better to send Harbhajan, now whatever decision Dhoni took, he did it but in any case Harbhajan Singh had more experience than Shardul Thakur.Ayaz Memon further says that Harbhajan Singh also had more strength to bear pressure.But he also believes that Dhoni might have thought that Shardul Thakur can take one or two runs faster with Ravindra Jadeja than Harbhajan Singh because he is young.I can't think of any other reason other than this.Whatever it may be, there cannot be a bigger disappointment for team Chennai and captain Dhoni than losing a game that was almost won.Watson getting run out Apart from this, the way in which opener Shane Watson got run out after Chennai was almost on the verge of victory was also the biggest reason for Chennai's defeat.Shane Watson last made Chennai champions for the third time in 2018 by scoring an unbeaten century against Hyderabad.The way he batted last Sunday also made it seem like he was repeating his previous innings.He scored 80 runs with the help of eight fours and four sixes in just 59 balls before getting run out.He managed to score an easy first run off the fourth ball of Lasith Malinga's last over at deep point, but in an attempt to keep the strike, he ran for the second run..On the other hand, Krunal Pandya took control of the ball and threw it quickly towards wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock.Quinton did not delay in taking the wicket but Watson was late in reaching the crease.There was a lot of distance between his creases when he was run out.His mistake almost snatched the match from Chennai.The amazing thing is that Ravindra Jadeja was supporting Shane Watson and he is considered a good hitter.Regarding Shane Watson's run out, cricket critic Vijay Lokpally clearly admits that he has a complaint against Watson.Vijay Lokpally says that Watson made such a great match and with the experience he has, he should have come back after winning the match.If he had won the match, cricket lovers would have remembered him for a long time as to how an aging player single-handedly won his team their second consecutive IPL final.Now after Mumbai's victory, it can be said that young Mumbai defeated the old lions but it should be remembered that these old lions fought with the young team till the last ball and lost by just one ball.Now it will also be called a coincidence that 35-year-old Lasith Malinga, who conceded 20 runs in his previous over before the last over, which was the 16th over of the innings, gave Mumbai the victory.Now he too is the old lion of Mumbai.(For BBC Hindi's Android app you can click here.You can also follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.)"}

{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content in one sentence.\n\nPower Point Administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\n\nManmohan Singh was seen as a slow and indecisive Prime Minister.Even those who are very sympathetic towards him would consider him an overly cautious leader.Manmohan Singh was also considered a weak and incapable Prime Minister to keep his word.Narendra Modi is considered a determined, strong, quick decision making and self-confident leader, unlike Manmohan Singh.Bhutan: Ten highlights of Modi's speech The news that has come in since he took office only confirms his unique style.In such a situation, it is necessary to consider some aspects of his personality..The first difference between Modi and his predecessors is the way he treats bureaucrats.On June 3, Modi held a meeting with secretaries of various departments of the Government of India.He wanted to understand what was going on in the country.In a media report after his meeting, he said, \"The top bureaucrats of the country were asked to give their presentation..According to the order issued on Saturday, every secretary was to be given ten minutes for his presentation in a Power Point presentation of 10 slides. The essence of files In one of his interviews, Modi said that he does not read files..In his words, he does not work in the 'academic study' way.To understand a subject, they do not read, but listen.Modi listens to bureaucrats who are expected to read all the files and convey their gist to Narendra Modi in a few lines.After this simplification, Modi will understand the issue and immediately give his decision or comment.PM Modi's preference for Power Point presentations, reducing complex and multifaceted issues to bullet points is in keeping with his style.I would like to mention point by point the three things about Narendra Modi which make me think.First, as a Prime Minister, Narendra Modi is a Prime Minister who is highly dependent on information from others.This shows a lack of interest or inability to read long documents.Second, the habit of taking decisions too quickly cannot be considered a good habit in every situation.When I said these things during a TV show, a retired bureaucrat participating in the program got angry.He said that this is nothing new, 'No Prime Minister reads files.' Although I was not able to compare the working styles of Modi and Manmohan.I find it hard to believe that they both work in the same way.Difficulties in decision making The adjectives I have used above for Manmohan Singh are based on his habit of going into great detail on a subject and his mastery over facts.His interviews reveal his grasp on complex issues.If he was, or was perceived to be, incapable of taking decisions, it was because if one delves too deeply into an issue and goes into the details of the facts, it becomes difficult to find an easy solution.Praveen Swami has given an example of such a case in an article published in The Hindu newspaper.Manmohan Singh considers options for possible retaliation after Mumbai attack by Lashkar-e-Taiba.The army told him that air strikes could be carried out on extremist camps but there was no \"precise coordinates and sufficient information about these camps\"..Swamy writes, \"The then Army Chief told the Prime Minister that he cannot guarantee that the special force attack will be successful..There can be no guarantee that the missile attacks will not turn into a war or even a nuclear war.And there is no guarantee that the Pakistani army will change its ways after this attack.\" Positive and negative aspects Manmohan Singh did not do anything at that time and it is very easy to understand why he did not do so.In such situations, not being able to take a decision or being confused is a good thing.Narendra Modi's third style is to maintain his control over things.A report published this week on Rediff.com said Modi is centralising decision-making power and authority in the Prime Minister's Office.The report said, \"Secretaries of various departments of the government have been asked to dispose of the files sent from the Prime Minister's Office immediately and the secretaries should not hold these files for the consideration of the concerned minister.\".\"This 'directive' will 'curtail the decision-making power' of various ministers,\" reports Rediff..Joint Secretary level officers of the Prime Minister's Office will monitor specific subjects and ministries and take decisions on the instructions of the Prime Minister.These secretaries, who head various departments, are expected to clear files without any delay.\" Narendra Modi's attitude can also be seen from a positive perspective.This can also be seen as a responsible attitude, in which the Prime Minister can praise himself by saying that he is personally looking after all the matters and he does not pass the buck to others.As was the case during Manmohan Singh's time.But the negative side of his working style is also evident, which we will not discuss today.(Click here for BBC Hindi's Android app.You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter.)"}

{"instruction": "Please summarize the following material in one sentence.\n\nHow effective is Mamata Banerjee's image-changing exercise?\n\nBecause of roaming freely and roaring in the jungle of politics throughout her life, she has been awarded with adjectives like 'Agnikanya' and 'Bengal's lioness'.After the setback in the Lok Sabha elections, the Trinamool Congress president had maintained silence for almost two months as part of an effort to change her image on the advice of election strategist Prashant Kishore..But breaking her silence this week at the Trinamool Congress Students Council, she was once again seen in her old aggressive mood.This has raised questions about how effective this image-changing exercise will be. On the advice of Prashant Kishor (PK), efforts are being made to change Mamata's image across the state..Under this, the 'Didi ko bolo' campaign was started under which banners with pictures of Mamata's smiling face have been put up across the state..'Bollo Didi' campaign: For the past two months, he had also reduced his attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP.A helpline has also been started under the 'Didi ko bolo' campaign so that people can convey their problems directly to her (Mamata).Mamata and senior party leaders have been advised to use caution while criticising opposition parties and avoid commenting on every issue.A Trinamool Congress leader says, \"Under the new strategy, it has been advised not to disrupt any event of the opposition parties so that the message goes to the people that Trinamool Congress believes in democracy.\" Keep in mind that during the recent Lok Sabha elections, Mamata government was heavily criticized for not allowing rallies and other programs of BJP President Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath..After the results of the Lok Sabha elections, Mamata has been criticized a lot for her aggressive statements against those chanting Jai Shri Ram and the issue of arrests of such people..'BJP's next target is now Bengal' On PK's advice, Mamata had kept herself restrained for almost two months.He had stopped attacking PM Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah.She appeared quite restrained in her comments on various issues including the abolition of the provisions of Article 370 in Kashmir..But at the student council rally in Kolkata on Wednesday, she was once again seen in her old avatar.Mamata said, \"The government is using brute force to stifle the voices of dissent in the Kashmir Valley.BJP's next target is now Bengal.Mamata challenged the Centre to arrest her for raising her voice against the government and said that she will not bow down to BJP under any circumstances..He alleges, \"The central government is either threatening opposition leaders through central agencies or buying them with money.Because of opposing the policies of the center and divisive politics, BJP is now after Bengal.\" The Centre needs to change its image 1.Referring to the Reserve Bank of India's decision to give Rs 76 lakh crore, the Chief Minister said that all the important institutions of the country are occupied by retired bureaucrats.These people are just agreeing with the government.Mamata said that the country is moving towards a presidential system and there will be no place for democracy in it.BJP is moving towards one government, one leader, one party and one emergency.All the other parties are falling apart.But why is there a need to change Mamata's image? Political analysts say that her party's image has been tarnished due to serious allegations of corruption and nepotism and the BJP has successfully capitalized on this issue in the Lok Sabha elections..Vishwanath Chakraborty, an analyst, says, \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah have been constantly mentioning tolabaazi or extortion in their election rallies..This helped him a lot in creating an atmosphere against Trinamool Congress.The party's image has taken a severe blow after the issue of cut money came to the fore after the elections.\" Mamata's changed attitude As part of the effort to change her image, leaders of opposition parties also mention Mamata's changed attitude as part of the effort to change her image.Congress MLA Abdul Mannan and Left Front leader Sujan Chakraborty say, \"Mamata regularly participated in the assembly proceedings last month and answered the opposition's questions..This is the first time this has happened since he came to power in 2011..\" But BJP's state president Dilip Ghosh says, \"As part of the policy of appeasing minorities, Mamata is speaking the language of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on the Kashmir issue..If their leaders have not done anything wrong, why are they afraid of central investigative agencies?\" Ghosh claims that no matter how hard Didi tries to change her image, the common people have understood the reality of her party.Now the time has come for Trinamool to leave power.Immaculate image...People have mixed opinions on how effective this effort to change Mamata's image will be.There is a consensus that it is difficult to control Mamata's aggressive and rebellious attitude for a long time.Amal Mukherjee, former principal of Presidency College, says, \"Recent events have tarnished the image of Trinamool among the common people.Mamata has not taken any strict action against corrupt leaders.This has sent the wrong message to people.\" Analysts say that there is no stain on Mamata's image.But he has been accused of protecting tainted leaders of the party.The success of the image makeover exercise largely depends on Mamata's attitude towards the corrupt leaders of the party and her restraint in language.But the million dollar question is how long can a lioness with a fighting and rebellious attitude be kept in a cage?
