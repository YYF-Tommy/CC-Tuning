{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content in one sentence..Will OPEC Plus replace OPEC? OPEC was founded in September 1960.In these lines, we will review a brief overview of the establishment of OPEC and its history, in addition to the changes that have recently swept the organization..The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was founded sixty years ago, during a conference in Baghdad between September 10 and 14, 1960..The organization was founded by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, and was joined by Qatar one year later, Indonesia and Libya two years later, the UAE in 1967, Algeria in 1969, Nigeria in 1971, Ecuador in 1973, Gabon in 1975, Angola in 2007, Equatorial Guinea in 2017 and Congo in 2018..Among these countries, Indonesia suspended its membership twice, the last time being in 2016, and its membership remains suspended to this day. Qatar also withdrew from the organization early last year..Ecuador withdrew earlier this year..Topics that may interest you End OPEC says its goal is to coordinate and unify the oil policies of member states in order to secure fair and stable prices for producers, provide adequate and regular supplies of oil at reasonable prices for consuming countries, and achieve reasonable profits for investors in the oil sector.But the first and primary goal of OPEC, the “oil exporters’ club,” is the interests of the member states, even though its strategy often includes taking into account the interests of consuming countries and companies..OPEC's 60th anniversary comes in an exceptional year by all standards for everyone, including the oil industry and OPEC countries..This year witnessed a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, which led to a huge increase in supply during the first months of the outbreak of the Corona pandemic and a significant drop in demand..The price war and the pandemic led to a historic drop in oil prices to below zero, before everyone realized the situation and the OPEC Plus group cut production by a historic amount..This war also came a few years after the formation of the OPEC Plus group, which included, in addition to OPEC membership, ten other non-OPEC oil exporting countries that were willing to cooperate, led by Russia..According to Bloomberg, this came after Saudi Arabia sensed, at the beginning of 2017, when the price of a barrel of oil fell to $25, that OPEC alone was either unwilling or unable to manage the oil markets, so the OPEC Plus group was created, which brought a larger number of countries to the table..Early Successes: In the early years of its establishment, the organization had a major impact in changing the balance of power between the member states on the one hand and the oil companies known as the Seven Sisters on the other hand, as the relationship was exploitative in favor of the latter..Anas Al-Hajji, editorial advisor for the “Energy” platform, says that the first achievement is “spending rents,” as companies used to consider the revenue they pay to countries in exchange for extracting and using the natural resource (oil) as part of taxes or profits, while countries began to demand that it be considered independent of anything else..This insistence has led to a significant increase in the revenues of these countries..The second achievement was to encourage member states to increase participation in companies so that they would not be entirely foreign. Member states implemented this either through nationalization, as was the case in Libya and Iraq, or through gradually purchasing shares, as in the Gulf states..This enabled these countries to control production and exports..From right, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo, and UAE Minister of Energy and Industry Suhail Al Mazrouei, at an OPEC meeting in Abu Dhabi on September 12, 2019..As for the issue of influencing prices through changing production and the amount of oil available in the markets, Anas says that OPEC was unable to inherit this role from the major oil companies completely, as the latter controlled “vertically and horizontally” the entire industry from oil exploration to its distribution to the consumer, while OPEC only controlled production and export..OPEC has historically been known to not force member states to cut production when it decides to do so, nor does it punish countries that do not comply with the decision..But this has now changed, as after the historic reduction decision following the price war and the Corona pandemic, attempts have begun to impose reduction decisions on countries that have not fully adhered to them..Al-Hajji added, \"But this new thing that happened in the last two months was done under the umbrella of OPEC Plus, not OPEC.\".It is noteworthy that talk about OPEC is gradually decreasing in the face of the emergence of OPEC Plus, and just as Saudi Arabia was the backbone of OPEC, the Saudi-Russian duo is the backbone of OPEC Plus..Saudi Arabia remains the most influential even in the era of OPEC Plus.Although Russia has produced more oil than Saudi Arabia in recent years, no one talks about Russia the way they do about Saudi Arabia..Why? Simply because Saudi Arabia is the only country that has spare production capacity that it can use at any time, and it is also the only country that can cut production in large quantities without this greatly affecting its economy..Russia cannot do that..Observers believe that using this card is costly for Saudi Arabia due to the economic crisis it is experiencing..Although it is able to withstand the decline in oil prices more than others, it is currently facing a severe economic crisis that casts a shadow over the economic vision it announced for the next decade..For OPEC and OPEC+, as for all oil-related stakeholders, one challenge may be the world's relentless attempts to reduce dependence on oil in order to combat climate change..But Al-Hajji believes that demand for oil will continue to grow at least until 2050, even if this growth is less than before, which means that OPEC and OPEC Plus will still have a role to play in the global oil market.."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the following in one sentence.\n\nSaudi Arabia ‘capable of acquiring nuclear weapons’ from Pakistan\nAlthough Saudi Arabia’s pursuit of nuclear weapons is often framed as a competition over Iran’s nuclear program, it can now deploy them faster than Iran. A NATO official said earlier that he had seen intelligence reports that nuclear weapons manufactured in Pakistan on behalf of Saudi Arabia were now ready for delivery. Amos Yadlin, the former head of Israel’s military intelligence, told a conference in Sweden that if Iran succeeded in building a nuclear bomb, “the Saudis will not wait a month. They have already paid for the bomb, they will go to Pakistan and bring what they need.” Since 2009, when Saudi King Abdullah warned US Middle East envoy Dennis Ross that “we will get nuclear weapons,” Saudi Arabia has been sending the United States several signals about its future intentions. Topics that may interest you End It is worth mentioning that reports of Saudi Arabia’s pursuit of missiles capable of launching nuclear warheads with long ranges go back decades. In this context, Saudi Arabia secretly purchased dozens of CSS-2 ballistic missiles from China in the 1980s. Saudi Arabia deployed these missiles on its territory twenty years ago. It became clear several years ago that Saudi Arabia had provided Pakistan with generous financial assistance, including assistance allocated for laboratories and the manufacture of nuclear missiles. It is worth mentioning that the visits of the late Saudi Defense Minister, Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz, in 1999 and 2002 to the Pakistani Nuclear Research Center highlight the close defense relationship between the two countries. Regardless of the accuracy of reports of understandings between the two countries during the 1990s, Saudi Arabia began serious strategic thinking in 2003 due to the changing security environment in the region and the possibility of nuclear proliferation there. A document leaked by Saudi officials that same year stated that Saudi Arabia had drawn up three future scenarios for dealing with this matter: the first scenario was to acquire the nuclear weapons it needed, the second scenario was to conclude an agreement with another nuclear power to protect the kingdom, and the third scenario was to rely on the possibility of a nuclear-weapons-free Middle East. The Saudis expressed their dissatisfaction with the removal of Saddam Hussein from power, expressed their dissatisfaction with American policy toward Israel, and expressed their growing concerns about the Iranian nuclear program. Diplomatic reports of Saudi-Pakistani nuclear cooperation increased in the following years. But the Saudi mission in the British capital, London, issued a statement saying that the kingdom had signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying that it was seeking to free the Middle East from nuclear weapons."}

Drink enough water during the day, but avoid drinking large amounts before bedtime..Of course, you don't want to wake up thirsty, but you also don't want to go to the bathroom more than once in the first hours of sleep..7- Think about what you drink. Beware of soft drinks, as many of them contain large amounts of caffeine, which is a substance that stimulates the central nervous system and makes us more alert..Avoid drinking too much alcohol as well..Many people tend to drink more alcohol when it is hot, especially during social occasions..Alcohol may make us feel sleepy, but it also causes us to wake up early and makes it less likely that we will get a good night's sleep..8- Keep calm If you have difficulty sleeping, get up and distract yourself with something calming..Try reading, writing, or even folding and arranging your socks..A warm bath before bed may help during hot weather but try not to be distracted by your phone or video games – blue light makes us less sleepy and the activity of playing video games is stimulating..Go back to bed when you feel sleepy..9- Think about your children. Children usually sleep soundly, but they are very sensitive to changes in the family’s “mood” or habits..Try to keep your bedtime and shower times, and don't change them because of the heat..It is recommended, as part of bedtime habits, to take a warm shower, according to some health tips..But make sure that the water is not cold, because this stimulates blood circulation, as the body tries to maintain its temperature..A young child cannot tell you if he or she is hot or cold, so it is important to monitor your children's temperatures..They fall asleep if their body temperature is between 16 and 20 degrees Celsius..You can place a thermometer where your children sleep, or touch their foreheads, backs or stomachs to check their temperature and whether they feel too hot..10- Ignore lack of sleep. Most of us need between seven and eight hours of sleep every night to be able to perform our duties properly..But remember that most people can function after a night or two of disturbed sleep..If this happens, you may yawn a little more than usual, but you will most likely be fine..The above advice is based on suggestions from Professor Kevin Morgan, former director of the Sleep Research Unit at Loughborough University, and Lisa Artis, who works for the Sleep Council.."}

They are very numerous and well-known to believers, and some of them sing them.”.The most famous of them in Lebanon and Syria among the Greek Orthodox and Greek Catholics: the Christmas canon (hymn), which begins (in Arabic) “Christ was born, glorify him,” and the Christmas troparion, which begins “Your birth, O Christ our God.”.There are also the Syriac Maronite liturgical hymns, which are sung in Syriac, the most famous of which are “Shobahou Lahaw Qolo” (Glory be to the Word, the Great Secret), and “Amanu Morio” (God is with us)..Abu Murad says: “These musical passages are based on basic scales in the liturgical tradition, and the scale is the model on which the melody is built.”.In terms of emotional impact, these hymns tend more towards joy..Rhythmically, the hymns follow the meter of the words, as they are still chanted in their original language, such as Syriac among the Maronites, and when they are translated into Arabic, words are arranged for them that attempt to preserve the poetic rhythm..Among the Greek Orthodox, it is chanted in Arabic to melodies that are often of Greek origin..Glorifying the Blessing According to the book “Coptic Contributions to Human Civilization” by Abdel Samuel, “The Coptic Church preserves an invaluable archaeological heritage in terms of church music due to its conservative nature that it inherited from ancient times (...Its roots go back to ancient Pharaonic music, whether they took it from it without modification or added spiritual depth to it..According to the book, the Copts give the melodies Christian features and meanings, but the essence is Pharaonic. The melody of “Golgotha,” which the priests chant on Good Friday in commemoration of the crucifixion of Christ, has its roots in the funeral rituals of ancient Egypt..According to the book “Coptic Hymns and Their Spirituality” by George Kyrollos, the “Eboro” hymn is said on Christmas, Epiphany, and Easter with a joyful arrangement, and is also said with an arrangement that suits Holy Week..The word \"Eboro\" in Coptic means \"O King of Peace.\".Another Coptic tradition is the Doxology hymns, a Greek word meaning “glorification of blessing,” which are hymns to all the various occasions, feasts, angels, and saints..On the occasion of Christmas, Doxologi sings a song titled “Tuti Ron Avmoh En Rashi,” which means “Then our mouth was filled with joy.”."}

Saudi authorities have arrested a number of wanted individuals, and others - from a list of 23 wanted individuals announced by the authorities in early 2012 - have surrendered themselves, following riots and violence in the region since February 2011. Topics that may interest you End Qatif witnessed demonstrations coinciding with the Bahraini protests, which quickly escalated in 2012, resulting in more than ten deaths. \"Marginalization\" The oil-rich Eastern Province is the main center for Shiites, who make up about 10 percent of Saudi Arabia's population of about 20 million. Members of the Shiite sect accuse the Saudi authorities of marginalizing them in administrative and military jobs, especially in the upper echelons of the state. Human rights organizations say that security forces have arrested more than 600 people in Qatif since the spring of 2011, but have released most of them. Last July, clashes between protesters and security forces escalated before subsiding in August following a call by Saudi King Abdullah to establish a dialogue center between Sunnis and Shiites, a move welcomed by seven of Qatif’s most prominent Shiite leaders. On Monday, the Public Prosecution Office at the Specialized Criminal Court in Riyadh handed over the indictment to defense attorneys for the controversial Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr, who has been detained since July. Human rights sources reported that the second session of the trial, which began on March 26, was brief, as it was limited to handing over the indictment, without setting a date for the next session. “The punishment for banditry” In the first session, the Public Prosecution Office had demanded that the punishment for banditry be carried out against al-Nimr, charging him with several charges, most notably “stirring up strife in Qatif,” “bringing foreign interference,” and “supporting rebellion in Bahrain.” On July 8, the Ministry of Interior announced the arrest of “one of the troublemakers, Nimr Baqir al-Nimr,” and that he had been injured in the thigh while “attempting to escape and resist security forces.” Al-Nimr is known for his hardline positions toward the authorities. The authorities consider al-Nimr, who has been arrested several times in the past, to be one of the most prominent instigators of demonstrations in Qatif. In 2009, he called for “the separation of Qatif and al-Ahsa and their return to Bahrain, to form one region, as they were before,” in reference to previous eras."}

{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content in one sentence.\n\nQ&A: China and the Uyghurs\nChina maintains a large military presence in Xinjiang Who are the Uyghurs? The Uyghurs are Muslims and their language is related to Turkic and they consider themselves ethnically and culturally close to the peoples of Central Asia. For centuries, the region’s economy has been based on agriculture and trade, with some cities, such as Kashgar, located on the Silk Road. Xinjiang was annexed by the Chinese Empire in the 18th century, and in the 1940s the Uyghurs briefly declared independence. The region came under full Communist Chinese control in 1949. China describes the region as autonomous, like Tibet to the south. What is China’s concern about the Uyghurs? Beijing says Uyghur militants have waged a violent campaign to establish an independent state by plotting bombings, sabotage and inciting unrest. Since the September 11 attacks in the United States, China has portrayed Uyghur separatists as agents of al-Qaeda. Beijing has accused them of receiving military training and religious instruction in neighboring Afghanistan from Islamic militants. Public evidence for the accusations is weak, however. The U.S. military detained more than 20 Uighurs after the invasion of Afghanistan, and although they were held at Guantanamo for six years, they were never charged. Albania accepted five of them in 2006, four were resettled in Bermuda in June 2009, and the Pacific island nation of Palau accepted the rest. What are the complaints against the Chinese in Xinjiang? Activists say the religious, commercial and cultural activities of Uighurs are being gradually restricted by the Chinese state. China is accused of intensifying repression of the Uighurs after the 1990s protests and the Beijing Olympics. In the past decade, several prominent Uighurs have been jailed or sought political asylum abroad on terrorism charges. Uighur dissidents say China is exaggerating the threat of Uighur separatism to justify its crackdown in the region. Beijing is also accused of seeking to undermine the influence of the Uighurs by organizing mass migrations of the Han ethnic group, China’s majority, into the region. The Han now make up about 40 percent of Xinjiang’s population, while the Uighurs make up about 45 percent. What is the current situation in Xinjiang? Over the past decade, major development projects have brought prosperity to Xinjiang’s major cities. Chinese authorities closely monitor the activities of Chinese and foreign journalists in the region, and there are few independent sources of information from the region. China highlights the region’s improving economy, while Uighurs interviewed by the press avoid criticizing Beijing. However, occasional attacks on Chinese targets suggest that the separatist movement remains active and a potential force for violence. Unrest in the regional capital, Urumqi, in July has so far left 156 people dead and about 1,000 injured. Chinese authorities blame Uighur separatists abroad, while the latter say police fired indiscriminately at a peaceful march demanding an investigation into the deaths of two Uighurs in a clash with Han Chinese at a factory in southern China."}
{"instruction": "Please summarize the following in one sentence.\n\nDo you have to pay to get rid of ransomware?\n\nWannaCry demands that victims pay a ransom to get their files back Most experts advise against paying the ransom, which can be as high as $300, which some may not think is a lot to pay for irreplaceable data. Given that you are dealing with criminals, there is no reason to expect them to be honest. Given the intent of WannaCry, it is unfortunate that users will not be able to recover their lost files even if they agree to pay. “You need human intervention to decrypt the files,” says Matthew Hickey, a cybersecurity researcher at Hacker House. Alan Woodward, a security expert at the University of Surrey, says victims are likely to contact the criminals to ask for a key to decrypt their files. But Woodward told the BBC: “I doubt anyone will answer your call, especially with all the attention this issue has had at the moment.” “If someone pays the ransom, it will most likely be in Bitcoin,” he added. What to do instead? Good news: Home users are unlikely to be among the vulnerable. WannaCry spread to workplace machines through a vulnerability in Windows that most home users have patched. So the vulnerability won’t be present in their Windows version, and there are unlikely to be vulnerable machines on their home network. For those who get infected, whether at work or in an organization, it’s highly likely that any files that aren’t backed up won’t be recoverable. That’s why experts stress the importance of backing up files to a separate hard drive or another device. Experts say it’s possible to remove WannaCry from your computer once it’s infected, although it’s a non-trivial process. The technical support site Bleeping Computer notes that removing the virus requires downloading some software to clean up the infection. Experts added that this procedure will not decrypt files that have been encrypted by the ransomware, while reiterating the importance of having backup copies of files."}

He asked in one tweet: \"Did China ask us if we should devalue their currency and build a massive military complex? I don't think so!\" Trump came to the brink of a diplomatic crisis with China last week by speaking directly to the president of Taiwan. This unusual move led China to file a \"strong protest\" with the United States. The United States has previously criticized China's devaluation of its currency, the \"yuan,\" saying that it gives an unfair advantage to Chinese exports. It has also demanded that China stop its influence over the territories and areas surrounding the islands in the South China Sea, whose ownership is disputed by several countries, and the United States has sent its warships to the region. The two countries have traded accusations of \"arming\" the region. 'A courtesy' Trump's call with Taiwan's president was the first time a US president has spoken to a Taiwanese since relations deteriorated in 1979. The White House said the call did not signal a shift in US policy toward a \"united China,\" which considers Taiwan part of China. Vice President-elect Mike Pence tried to downplay the call. He told NBC News on Sunday that it was a \"storm in a teacup.\" \"I say to our Chinese counterparts that this was a courtesy moment,\" he said. Chinese state media reported that Beijing had formally raised the issue with Washington, and urged the United States to \"handle Taiwan very carefully and carefully.\" Taiwan considers itself an independent country, while China views it as a province.

Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesman, told reporters in Geneva that the disorder will be included in its 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases. The WHO is tasked with updating ICD-11, which includes contributions from a large number of doctors around the world. Jasarevic said the definition the organization is currently working on is “a pattern of gaming behavior, which can be electronic or video gaming, characterized by a lack of control over gaming, and its prevalence at the expense of other activities to the point of taking precedence over other interests.” He added that other symptoms of the disorder include “continued gaming and even increased gaming despite negative consequences.” Jasarevic went on to say that the interim guidelines suggest that a person must have demonstrated an abnormal addiction to video gaming for at least one year before being diagnosed with the disorder, which would be classified as an “addictive behaviour”. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that the disorder disproportionately affects younger people who are more involved in the increasingly active world of online video gaming. But the WHO spokesman cautioned that it was too early to speculate on the scale of the problem. Gaming disorder is a relatively new concept, he said, and population-level epidemiological data are not yet available. He added that despite the lack of reliable information, “health experts basically agree that there is a problem” and that formal inclusion of the disorder in the ICD is the next appropriate step."}

In recent years, the Catalan giant, led by its Argentine star Lionel Messi, has succeeded in achieving many major achievements, both on and off the field..But things began to change at Camp Nou, with the team's performances affected by the departure of Spanish coach Pep Guardiola at the end of 2012, and many question marks were raised about the club's business operations..When the club signed Brazilian star Neymar from Brazilian club Santos last June, the Spanish club officials announced that the deal was worth 45 million pounds..A member of Barcelona's board of directors, a pharmacist named Jordi Cases, questioned the value of the deal and asked the club's board of directors for clarification..When he did not find a response, he went to the Spanish courts, which opened an investigation into the matter..Topics that may interest you End Club president Sandro Rosell resigned over the deal last January and the Spanish public prosecutor said he would open an investigation into the matter to find out whether the club's board of directors manipulated the value of the deal to evade taxes.The club said it had nothing to hide, but club president Sandro Rosell resigned in January following intense public pressure..Rosell said he resigned for personal reasons, but was responsible for the controversial signing of the 22-year-old Brazilian star, who is one of the most prominent talents in the world of football today..Shortly after Rosell's departure, his successor Josep Maria Bartomeu held a press conference to announce the true value of the deal, which he said was £71m..In an unprecedented move, Bartomeu, a close friend of Rosell's who was the club's vice-president at the time of Neymar's signing, announced the details of the deal..Bartomeu said the Spanish club paid 33 million pounds to Neymar's father as compensation to secure Neymar's transfer to Barcelona, ​​while Santos received 14 million pounds..Barcelona paid £8m immediately after signing the contract, plus a £6m buy-out clause giving the club preference in signing Santos players in the future, £2m in agent fees (also paid to Neymar's father), and a further £2m to Neymar's charity foundation in Brazil..Barcelona also announced that Neymar will receive an annual salary of 9 million pounds..These are truly mind-boggling numbers, and I can't remember a major European club ever detailing a player's transfer in this way..In fact, these details give an insight into the sporting deals and the money clubs pay to secure the signing of prominent players – especially from South America, where big stars emerge whose contracts are owned by major companies and wealthy individuals, not clubs..Barcelona revealed the details of the deal in the hope that this would help solve the problem and keep the club away from legal problems, but Judge Pablo Ruz announced two weeks ago that the Spanish judiciary would continue to consider the case..Barcelona were forced to pay £11m to the Spanish finance ministry in taxes on the deal in order to have the case against the club dropped, but Jordi Cases' lawyer told the BBC he believed the case would continue to be heard by the courts..I asked Parmutio last Monday how he was working to improve the club's image, and he replied: \"It is our duty to explain to everyone that we have done everything right..If some people think that Barcelona's reputation has been affected negatively, we have to work on fixing that.\".\"We believe we are right,\" he added..We are not happy with this situation, but we will defend our club with all our strength when we appear in court.”.Barmuto said the dispute revolved around who should pay the taxes: should they be paid by Neymar's father in Brazil, or should they be paid in Spain because these payments are part of the player's contract? Barcelona are looking to bounce back from their recent defeat to Valladolid, so the question is why did the club pay £11m?

Malian officials had said that the prime minister was arrested late Monday while trying to leave the country for France. A Malian military spokesman told the BBC that Cheikh Mobido Diarra was suspected of trying to jeopardize the political dialogue scheduled to move the country towards democracy. The arrest was made on the orders of military personnel who helped stage the coup in March, the source said. AFP quoted a source close to the prime minister as saying the arrest was ordered by former coup leader Amadou Sanogo. \"The prime minister was arrested by about 20 soldiers who came from Kati,\" the source added, referring to the military garrison outside Bamako from which the putschists set out. \"They stormed the prime minister's home and took him away in a rather brutal manner,\" the source said. Diarra was about to travel to France for medical treatment. The same source said Cheick Modibo Diarra had planned to travel to Paris on Monday evening for medical checks, but changed his mind when he learned that his bags had been taken off the plane that was taking him to France. The prime minister had recorded a short message that was to be broadcast on national television soon, but military personnel went to the television headquarters in Bamako and confiscated the recording, the source added. Tensions have been escalating in recent weeks between the military personnel who led the coup and the civilian prime minister they were forced to appoint. Plan for military intervention Captain Amadou Sanogo overthrew President Amadou Toumani Touré in a military coup on March 22. Vast areas of desert larger than France fell under the control of radical Islamist groups in the chaos that followed the military coup in Mali, which was considered one of the most stable democratic countries in Africa. Sanogo was forced to return power to civilians two weeks after the coup, but he and his men still enjoy significant influence in Bamako. A military force arrested the Malian prime minister. The African Union approved a plan for military intervention in Mali to help its government extend its control over the country, especially in the north, which has been controlled since the end of June by armed Islamist groups linked to Al-Qaeda. The Union called on the UN Security Council to issue a mandate to deploy an African military force in Mali.

They explained that this increase is occurring in every region of the world, and in almost every country in the world. Hundreds of thousands of people are malnourished due to excess weight, as well as excess sugar, salt and cholesterol in the blood, according to the report. “Totally unacceptable” The study “redefines what the world thinks of as malnutrition,” said Corinna Hawkes, who co-authored the study. “Malnutrition literally means that someone is not getting enough nutrition. There are outcomes like being too thin or not growing fast enough. Or it could mean being obese or having high blood sugar, which can lead to diabetes.” While many countries are on track to meet their targets for reducing stunting and reducing the number of underweight children, few are making progress in tackling obesity and related diseases such as heart disease. The number of overweight children under five is fast approaching the number of underweight children, according to the report. “We are now living in a world where malnutrition is the new normal,” said Lawrence Haddad, co-leader of the study. “It’s a world that we all have to say is completely unacceptable.” The report called for more money and political commitment to address the problem, noting that every dollar spent on nutrition programmes generates $16 in benefits."}

The region's history dates back to the Middle Ages, and many of the region's people believe that they are a nation independent of the rest of Spain. These feelings are reinforced by memories associated with the period of Francisco Franco, who tried to suppress Catalan identity, and this is clearly reflected in the fierce rivalry between FC Barcelona and rival Real Madrid, which represent the pinnacle of Spanish football. The region is located in the far north-east of Spain, and is separated from the south of France by the Pyrenees Mountains, with which the region has close ties. Most of the region's population lives in its capital, Barcelona, ​​which is an important economic and political center, as well as a popular tourist attraction. Barcelona has political, economic and tourist weight, and the region is also famous for its traditional industries, chemicals, processed foods and metals, as well as its thriving service sector. History The region first emerged as a distinct identity with the rise of the province of Barcelona in the 11th and 12th centuries to the same royal rule as the neighbouring Kingdom of Aragon and to become a major maritime power in the Middle Ages. Catalonia had been part of Spain since its inception in the 15th century when Ferdinand, King of Aragon, and Isabella, Queen of Castile, married to unite their kingdoms. In the 19th century, a renewed sense of Catalan identity developed into a campaign for political independence and even secession, and this period saw a revival of Catalan identity. When Spain became a republic in 1931, Catalonia was granted wide-ranging autonomy during the Spanish Civil War, and was a major Republican stronghold. The fall of Barcelona to General Franco in 1939 marked the beginning of the end of the Spanish resistance. Under Franco's hardline rule, autonomy was abolished, Catalan nationalism was suppressed, and the use of the Catalan language was restricted. Politics and Language With the advent of democracy in Spain after Franco's death, Catalonia has its own parliament with wide-ranging autonomy. Charles Puigdemont, President of the Catalan Regional Government The decline of the Spanish economy in recent years has fueled separatist sentiment in Catalonia, where many believe the region pays too much to Madrid. The regional government, in power since the November 2012 elections and supported by the two main separatist parties, held a non-binding referendum on independence in 2014, with 80 percent voting yes, while the Spanish government said Catalonia had no constitutional right to secede. Catalan is an official language of the region alongside Spanish and its use is encouraged in education and the media. Most of the region's population speaks both languages. Catalan is also spoken in Valencia in the south, the Balearic Islands and the Rozalin region of France, so Catalan nationalists consider these areas to constitute \"Catalan states\"."}

The bill will now go to the upper house, where it is likely to be approved. ‘Instant divorce’ is a legal practice among Muslims and is referred to as ‘irrevocable divorce’. In recent years, there have been several cases of Muslim men in India divorcing their wives in this way. The methods used varied, either by letter, by phone, or more recently, new ways of communicating the divorce have become popular, such as by text message, Skype or WhatsApp. India’s Supreme Court declared ‘instant divorce’ unconstitutional in August, but officials in India say the practice continues despite the court’s ruling. The ruling came after five Muslim women petitioned the court, arguing that the traditional practice violates their fundamental rights. The ruling, which described instant divorce as an “un-Islamic” practice, was delivered by a majority of three judges to two. The proposed new law also provides for financial penalties for men and support for women affected by divorce. The draft law on protection of marriage rights of Muslim women has been sent to state administrations for consultation.

Margaret Sanger, the birth control activist who urged scientists to develop it, wanted to liberate women sexually and socially, so that they would become equal to men..But the pill not only brought about a social revolution, it brought about an economic revolution as well—perhaps the most important economic change of the late twentieth century..To understand why birth control pills are economically important, we must first look at what they offer women..At first, these pills did the trick - unlike many other methods..For centuries, men and women have tried all sorts of unattractive methods of birth control, from crocodile dung in ancient Egypt to Aristotle's recommendation of cedar oil to Casanova's method of using half a lemon as a cervical cap..But even the modern alternative to the pill - the condom - doesn't work as well as hoped..Because people don't use it as it's supposed to, it sometimes tears or slips..So, for every 100 women whose partners use condoms for a year, 18 women become pregnant..There is a similar failure rate to the contraceptive sponge..The so-called female condom wasn't much better..But the pill's failure rate - with typical use - is only six percent, and it is three times safer than condoms..Margaret Sanger opened the first family planning center in New York in 1916. The economic revolution required the use of modern condoms with a partner, while there was some difficulty with the female condom and sponge..But the decision to use birth control pills comes from the woman herself, and it is also private..So, it was not surprising that women preferred these pills..Birth control pills were first approved in the United States in 1960..Within just five years, nearly half of married women seeking birth control were using it..But the real revolution came when unmarried women were able to use birth control pills..That took some time..Around 1970, a decade after the pill was first approved, state after state began making it easier for single women to get the pill..Universities opened family planning centers..By the mid-1970s, the pill was overwhelmingly the most popular method of contraception among 18- and 19-year-old women in the United States..And then the economic revolution really began..Women in the United States are beginning to enter fields of study such as law, medicine, dentistry and business administration that were previously largely male-dominated..In 1970, males represented more than 90 percent of those studying medicine, more than 95 percent of those studying law and business administration, and 99 percent of those studying dentistry..But in the early 1970s, the proportion of women - as a result of the use of birth control pills - increased in all of these specialties..Initially, women made up 20 percent, then 25 percent of these specialties, before their number reached a third by 1980..These Harvard graduates had the freedom to develop their careers before having children if they wanted to. Career advancement The percentage of female students studying majors such as medicine and law rose dramatically, and the percentage of women in those professions soon increased..But what does this have to do with the pill? The pill allowed women to control their fertility, which allowed them to focus on their careers..Before the pill, taking five or more years to graduate from medical or law school was not a good option in terms of time or money..In order to reap the benefits of these specialties, women needed to postpone childbearing until they were at least thirty years old..Having a child at the wrong time threatened to disrupt the mother's studies or delay her career advancement..A sexually active woman trying to become a doctor, dentist or lawyer was like someone building a factory in an earthquake zone: a bit of bad luck could end an expensive investment..Postponing marriage A woman can simply abstain from sex if she wants to study for her career, but many do not want to do that..It wasn't just about fun, it was about marriage..Before the pill, people got married at a younger age..A woman who decided to abstain from sex to focus on her career would find a husband by the age of 30, which meant that the right men were already married..But the pill changed all that, and unmarried women could now have sex with a much lower chance of unwanted pregnancy..The pill also changed the whole pattern of marriage, as everyone started marrying later in life, even women who did not use birth control pills..Childbearing has been delayed, and childbearing now occurs at the time of the woman’s choosing..This means that women now have enough time to focus on their professional lives..Did the lack of widespread availability of contraception lead to gender inequality in Japan? Gains increased Abortion was legalized, anti-discrimination laws were passed, a feminist movement emerged demanding gender equality, and the entry of young men into the U.S. military to fight in the Vietnam War forced employers to hire more women..But a careful statistical study by Harvard economists Lawrence Katz and Claudia Golden confirms that the pill has played a major role in allowing women to delay marriage and childbearing, and to invest in their careers..Golden and Katz monitored the availability of birth control pills to young women in the United States, state by state..They showed that the more access a state provided to contraception, the higher the rate of enrollment in vocational courses, and the higher the wages of women..A few years ago, economist Amalia Miller used a variety of clever statistical techniques to show that if a woman in her 20s could delay childbearing for one year, her lifetime earnings would rise by 10 percent..This was a measure of the many advantages a woman would gain if she completed her studies and secured her career before having children..Alternate Reality But young women in the 1970s didn't need to see Amalia Miller's research, because they already knew it was true..When the pill became available, young women applied for long careers in unimaginable numbers..Today's American woman can look across the Pacific for an alternate reality..In Japan, one of the most technologically advanced societies in the world, the birth control pill was not approved until 1999..Japanese women had to wait 39 years longer than their American counterparts to use the same contraceptive methods..In contrast, when sexual stimulants, such as Viagra, were approved for erection enhancement in the United States, Japan approved their use within a few months..It is widely acknowledged that gender inequality in Japan is worse than anywhere else in the developed world, with women still struggling for recognition in the workplace..It is impossible to separate cause from effect here, but experience in the United States suggests that what happened was no coincidence. Delaying the use of birth control pills for two generations would have a huge economic impact on women..These little grains are still changing the shape of the global economy.."}

Six major hospitals and 20 clinics suffered partial or major structural damage in the Beirut port explosion. The blast also left some 300,000 people homeless. Many are now living in damaged buildings, makeshift sites or shared shelters, with limited water and sanitation. The disaster has compounded Lebanon’s already dire situation due to a severe economic downturn exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization said last week that Lebanon had done an “impressive job” of tackling the coronavirus, which has killed some 107 people in the country since February. However, before the explosion, daily new cases were on the rise, and the government had planned to impose a partial lockdown to help manage the burden on hospitals.

{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content in one sentence.\n\nAlgeria: Will Abdelmadjid Tebboune restore stability to the streets?\nAspirations for stability await President Abdelmadjid Tebboune. This is what the National Independent Election Authority announced on Friday afternoon, awaiting the final official approval of this result by the Constitutional Council during the coming week. With this result, candidate Tebboune, who ran as an independent candidate, has decided the outcome and there is no longer any need for a second round. Like his rivals, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, 74, has been a political figure known to Algerians since 1991. He was a member of the ruling party, the National Liberation Front. He held several ministerial positions, including the ministries of housing and urban planning and communication. In May 2017, he became prime minister, but left the position after only three months following a disagreement with the entourage of former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. At the beginning of his announcement of the results of the vote, the head of the Independent Election Authority, Mohamed Charfi, said that the elections were held in an atmosphere of freedom and transparency and congratulated the Algerian people on their \"achievement\" in completing the voting process. He also praised the role of the military establishment in facilitating the election of a new president for the country. State television considered the announced turnout rate satisfactory as it legitimizes the voting process and its results. Topics that may interest you End Despite the fact that demonstrators briefly stormed a polling station in the capital and two others in the Kabylie region, and the disruption of voting on election day, the ruling authorities believe that these events did not affect the outcome of the elections. Despite the intensive campaign by the official media to convince voters to stop demonstrating and participate in the voting, a segment of demonstrators continued their protests and gathered in the streets of several cities, demanding change and rejecting the elections on the grounds that the candidates were linked to President Bouteflika’s regime. Many Algerians took to social media to express their rejection through the hashtags “No elections with gangs” and “They must all be removed.” With the completion of the election of a new president in Algeria, the military authorities, which run the country, hope that the demonstrators, or the majority of them, will be convinced that the former regime is gone and that the path to returning to stability passes through the palace of the new president, who will work to develop a roadmap that responds to the demands of the protesters in a transparent democratic system. However, it does not seem that all the demonstrators agree on the way to deal with the new president’s regime. There is a division of opinion. The first believes that the opportunity to elect a new president with electoral legitimacy is favorable to resolving the crisis and entering into a dialogue with him on implementing the demands of the movement. The participation rate in the elections (39%) confirms the existence of this segment that has begun to realize that the demonstrations are losing their effectiveness. As for the second opinion, which fills the streets and social media pages, it does not believe that there is any intention whatsoever on the part of the ruling military authority to respond to the demands of the demonstrators. Rather, it considers the organization of the elections and the recognition of the new president as a circumvention of the demands of the protesters and the preservation of the structure of a military political system with a civilian facade. To get out of the current crisis, the new president will have to take initiatives, perhaps by setting a clear roadmap to win over his opponents among the demonstrators and prove to them his sincere intention to engage in calm and measured dialogue with them and to appear with an independent position far from what the protesters consider to be dictates from the army generals."}

The Palestinian National Consensus Government had decided to consider March 8 an official holiday \"in honor of women,\" and it was already effective in the West Bank. Hamas did not provide any reason for canceling the holiday on International Women's Day, and the Hamas movement, which has controlled the Strip for more than 10 years, did not abide by the decision, as studies and work hours continued as usual in the various ministries and agencies.

However, if it was due to a technical failure, it will be blamed. Tourism has long been the mainstay of the Egyptian economy, which is the second largest economy in the Arab world after Saudi Arabia..But with recent attacks on Western tourists and the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) controlling large swaths of neighbouring Libya, foreign tour operators are reluctant to operate in Egypt..Before the fall of President Hosni Mubarak's regime in 2011, as part of the so-called Arab Spring revolutions, the tourism sector accounted for 10 percent of Egypt's workforce and contributed about 12.$5 billion annually in state revenues.During that period, Egypt was able to increase the number of tourists to 15 million tourists in the world, through many attractive tourist attractions such as the pyramids in Giza and the tourist resorts in Sharm El Sheikh..Topics that may interest you End But the picture is completely different now, Sharm El-Sheikh is still among the destinations that the British Foreign Office has warned against traveling to, especially by air, after the crash of the Russian passenger plane that took off from the city’s airport last October.The Mediterranean resort of Hurghada also witnessed an attack by suspected ISIS militants who stabbed three Western tourists last January, but the wounded were not seriously injured..The British Foreign Office said: \"Terrorists continue to plan to carry out attacks in Egypt, and there is a possibility of more attacks.\".Egypt has worked hard to restore its tourism status during the past period and has spent millions to develop security systems and promote its enormous potential. Losses are inevitable and it is still unclear why the Egyptian plane crashed and whether it was due to a terrorist act or another accident..But in any case, the Egyptian economy will suffer as a result of its fall, according to Dr Yeganeh Morakapati, an expert in international relations, risk and terrorism at Bournemouth University..\"If it was a terrorist act, Egypt would be a victim,\" she told BBC Radio 5 Live..She added, \"If it is a technical glitch, the media and people will blame it on the lack of Egyptian efficiency, and I feel that a technical glitch will never be good for the Egyptian economy.\".Mike Bogsgang, CEO of the Tour Operators Association, also expressed concern about the potential consequences for Egyptian tourism..\"It is clear that what happened was a terrible case, and it has not yet been proven that it was an act of terrorism, but if it is true, it could constitute a major crisis for the Egyptian tourism industry, which is already ongoing, especially with the recent events,\" he told the BBC..No wonder, then, that the number of tourists to Egypt is declining..By 2013, it had fallen by a third to less than 10 million tourists a year, and that number has undoubtedly fallen further since then..Last year's tourism revenues amounted to 6.$1 billion, which is slightly less than half of the revenue in 2010..International tour operators can withstand this kind of collapse in demand: they can simply promote alternative destinations that are seen as safer..Beachgoers have shifted their destinations to countries such as Spain, which has seen a “huge surge” in summer bookings this year, and to Bulgaria, says Bugsgang..Of course, this is bad news for all Egyptians who depend on foreign visitors for their livelihoods, including: hotel workers, tour guides, taxi drivers and stall owners in local markets and bazaars..The only beneficiaries of what is happening in Egypt are the armed Islamist groups, which are determined to inflict economic damage and destabilize the government, not only in Egypt, but also in other popular destinations in the region, such as Tunisia..British tourism companies will not abandon Egypt and everyone knows that the only beneficiaries are extremist organizations. A security campaign and the Egyptian authorities will not stand idly by and allow the tourism industry to collapse..New security upgrades are being planned, including a £20m programme to add more CCTV cameras and other measures, such as police dogs..The usual security procedures are in place for people entering Sharm el-Sheikh, and police regularly search vehicles in Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada..“We have put in a lot of new equipment, and we will continue to put in a lot of new equipment,” said Egypt’s new tourism minister, Yehia El-Rashed, a former Marriott International executive who started his work two months ago with the aim of revitalizing the industry..We train and retrain employees..But despite his statements that Egypt is 100 percent safe, visitors need some convincing..For his part, Bogsgang believes that Egypt can recover from the current tourism turmoil, but it will take some time..“Tourist destinations are very diverse and flexible in rebounding,” he says..“There are many examples over the years, and there is the fact that Egypt is very popular among British beachgoers,” he explained..He points out that the Egyptians are investing \"huge sums of money\" in security systems, expressing his confidence \"that the British travel industry will continue to support Egypt's move forward in every way possible, but in accordance with the advice of the Foreign Office.\".\"I am confident that she will be able to return, although it will not be in the near future,\" he said in the end.."}

The court’s decisions send mixed messages to the parties to the current abortion debate..In an unsigned opinion, the justices upheld Indiana's requirement that all fetal remains, whether resulting from miscarriage or stillbirth, be either buried or cremated..Anti-abortion activists saw the provision as a step toward defining post-abortion fetal tissue as not medical waste, but human remains that deserved dignified treatment..While pro-abortion rights groups have responded that the Supreme Court did not, in a previous ruling, consider a fetus to be a human being..The purpose of Indiana's law, Planned Parenthood wrote in a statement, is to \"shame and stigmatize\" women seeking abortions..A majority of the justices sided with Indiana, holding that the burial rule did not place an “undue burden” on a woman’s right to an abortion and served a legitimate state interest, even if the law was not “fully designed” to “handle fetal remains in all circumstances.”.Part II of the Indiana law discussed where real fireworks could be used, but that was not addressed..The justices declined to change or even review a lower court ruling that invalidated part of Indiana's law banning elective abortions based on the fetus's race, sex or disability..While there is little evidence that abortions are performed based on race or gender in the United States, doctors regularly test for fetal abnormalities and offer parents the choice to terminate the pregnancy..US state passes bill to ban abortion entirely 'Abortion America' softens UN resolution on sexual violence in war Meet the country where abortion rates exceed childbirth If the court chooses to hear the case, with full legal briefings, oral arguments and a ruling expected next year, it could be a way to reverse the 1973 Roe v.

Wade..However, Tuesday's decisions, issued without much fanfare and without advance notice, could be an indication that the majority of the court's justices are in no hurry to reverse a ruling issued, as a precedent, 46 years ago..But that will not prevent the issue from being dragged into the ongoing disputes over the US President's policies..Several Democratic candidates are calling for legislation from Congress that would protect abortion rights across the United States, including in states that have recently tried to limit the procedure..Meanwhile, President Trump has stressed his opposition to abortion except in cases of rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother..A St. Louis abortion clinic announced Tuesday that it may have to stop performing abortions on Friday because the state has not yet renewed its license..If that happens, Missouri would be the first state since Roe v. Wade to decide not to have abortion clinics within its borders..There are five other states that have only one clinic..The Indiana ruling could signal that the Supreme Court doesn't want to delve into abortion policy in the middle of a presidential campaign season..The justices may sidestep the issue for now, but they can do little to stop the escalating heated battle over the Roe v.

The decision came after a series of emergency meetings in the White House that revealed divisions within the US administration over intervention in Syria. Therefore, the US president announced his intention to supply the Syrian opposition with weapons directly..However, the announcement of the US decision was marked by the caution that has characterized the Obama administration’s handling of the Syrian crisis from the beginning, a reflection of the differences of opinion within its ranks about what should be done and the potential consequences of any action the United States might take..American policy may be about to change, but we still don't know what Washington's next move will be..Will the White House make public the evidence on which it based its latest decision? Topics that may interest you End of last April, the US administration told us that US intelligence agencies are “confident to varying degrees” that the Syrian regime is still using chemical weapons against the opposition.However, the British and French governments were more frank..Now the American assessment has come closer to the Anglo-French position..According to US Deputy National Security Adviser Benjamin Rhodes, there is now “high certainty” that Syrian regime forces have used “chemical weapons, including the nerve agent sarin, at a low level several times in the past year.”.\"So what has changed? Have the Americans found new evidence? And will this evidence be made public? These questions inevitably lead to the important question, which is what the United States intends to do..The military aid that the Americans will provide to the armed Syrian opposition will likely not go beyond - initially at least - supplying it with light weapons and equipment..Rhodes says that President Obama has not yet reached a decision on the possibility of taking military steps such as imposing no-fly zones in Syria, and he completely rejects the idea of ​​using American ground forces..As for the Syrian opposition's request to be supplied with anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons, this request is still under study and scrutiny in Washington..Therefore, the American response to President Assad’s crossing of the “American red line” seems hesitant at best, because the number of questions it raises is greater than the number of answers it provides..Will the policy of arming the opposition succeed? The military situation in Syria remains unclear, but it is clear that the opposition suffered a major setback in the town of Qusayr, and that government forces and their allies are advancing towards Aleppo..But was the reason behind these failures a lack of weapons, or was it due to poor training and lack of coordination between the various armed opposition forces? We know that the opposition does have large quantities of weapons, thanks to its Gulf and other backers..So what difference will American weapons make? If supplying the rebels with American weapons does not change the balance of power on the ground, what should the Americans do then? Will Washington provide the rebels with more sophisticated and deadly weapons? Will this require American training? Will all this lead to a spiral that ends in direct intervention? Can a setback be avoided? Western experts speak confidently of the assurances that will be obtained to ensure that the weapons do not fall into the hands of middlemen or militants linked to Al Qaeda. But what use are those assurances? Is this a reason not to supply the rebels with more sophisticated weapons such as anti-aircraft missiles? What will be the Russian response? This will be discussed in detail at the G8 meetings scheduled to be held in Northern Ireland next week..Although Obama seemed cautious in this regard, the voices of pressure groups in the United States called for more caution so as not to complicate matters further, as Syria has become a hotbed that could spark war in the entire region..The conflict may extend to Iraq and Jordan, in addition to Lebanon and perhaps Israel..Obama's move to arm the opposition may represent evidence of his inability to evade the moral responsibility he must assume, while other countries see that the move may prolong the conflict indefinitely, which explains the naming of the Syrian conflict as a \"crisis from hell.\"."}
