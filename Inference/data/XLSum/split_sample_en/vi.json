Osaka was overwhelmed in the first set and looked to be in danger of losing when trailing 3-0 in the second but then won 10 of the next 12 games. The comeback ensured Osaka, who won the 2018 US Open and 2019 Australian Open, maintained her record of winning every Grand Slam final she has played. Azarenka, 31, of Belarus, who eliminated Serena Williams in the semi-finals also 1-6 6-3 6-3, won the first set but lost the other two to Osaka. US Open: Djokovic apologises after disqualification “Congratulations to Naomi and her team. I hope we can meet again in other finals,” said Azarenka. “Congratulations to Naomi and her team.

A remarkable second US Open Grand Slam before Azarenka played with inspiration – and the Japanese player showed mental toughness in the final set. Osaka has not only impressed on court in the Cincinnati Masters-US Open side event over the past month, she has also won many admirers for her activism in the fight against racism and police brutality in the United States. Days before the US Open began, Osaka withdrew from the Western and Southern Open semifinals to protest the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a black man, in Wisconsin. Before her first-round US Open match, she wore a mask with the name of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was shot and killed by a police officer in March.

Based on the report of the Central Inspection Committee, the Politburo and the Party Secretariat concluded: \"The Standing Committee of the Ho Chi Minh City Party Committee for the 2010-2015 term violated the principle of democratic centralism and the Working Regulations of the City Party Committee; lacked responsibility, slackened leadership, direction, management, lacked inspection and supervision, allowing many violations and shortcomings to occur over a long period of time in the implementation of the Thu Thiem New Urban Area Investment Project. Thiem, negatively affects the reputation of the Party Committee and the City government, causing outrage in society, to the point of having to consider and take disciplinary action.\" The Standing Committee of the Ho Chi Minh City Party Committee for the 2010-2015 term was reprimanded. Mr. Le Thanh Hai was removed from the position of Secretary of the Ho Chi Minh City Party Committee for the 2010-2015 term. Still holding the position of \"former member of the Politburo\"? Mr. Le Thanh Hai was a former member of the Politburo of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, 10th and 11th terms. He was also Secretary of the Ho Chi Minh City Party Committee for two terms, from 2006 to the end of 2015. The announcement of the Politburo on March 20 only said \"discipline comrade Le Thanh Hai by removing him from the position of Secretary of the Ho Chi Minh City Party Committee for the 2010-2015 term\". Thus, it can be understood that Mr. Le Thanh Hai will still be called a former member of the Politburo of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, 10th and 11th terms. Similarly, he still holds the position of \"former Secretary of the Ho Chi Minh City Party Committee for the 2006-2010 term\". Taking primary responsibility, the Politburo concluded that Mr. Hai was primarily responsible for the violations and shortcomings of the Standing Committee and the Standing Committee of the City Party Committee for the 2010-2015 term in leading and directing the investment in the Thu Thiem New Urban Area. \"He personally violated the principle of democratic centralism and the Working Regulations of the City Party Committee, directly concluding on many issues under the authority of the Standing Committee of the City Party Committee.\" \"In his position as Deputy Secretary of the City Party Committee, Secretary of the Party Committee, Chairman of the City People's Committee, he was primarily responsible for the violations of the City People's Committee; directly signing a number of documents that were not in accordance with the policies of the City People's Council and the provisions of the 2002 Budget Law and the 2003 Construction Law.\" In addition, Mr. Le Hoang Quan, former Chairman of the City People's Committee, was warned by the Politburo. In early March, the Central Inspection Commission proposed that the Politburo and the Secretariat consider and discipline the Standing Committee of the Ho Chi Minh City Party Committee for the 2010-2015 term; Mr. Le Thanh Hai and Mr. Le Hoang Quan. The announcement on March 5 of the Central Inspection Commission is the latest update, following an announcement by this agency in January. The commission also proposed that the Secretariat consider disciplining Mr. Le Hoang Quan, former Chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee. In January, the announcement of the Central Inspection Commission said that a series of senior leaders of Ho Chi Minh City in the 2010-2016 period had committed violations during the implementation of the Thu Thiem New Urban Area investment project. However, on March 5, this agency said that the violations of the two men, Nguyen Van Dua, former Standing Deputy Secretary of the City Party Committee, and Vu Hung Viet, former Vice Chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee, were serious enough to require disciplinary action in the form of a reprimand, but the statute of limitations for disciplinary action according to Party regulations had expired. The remaining person, Ms. Nguyen Thi Hong, former Vice Chairwoman of the City People's Committee, was reprimanded by the disciplinary committee. Mr. Le Thanh Hai, once one of the most famous and powerful politicians in Vietnam, retired after the 12th Party Congress in 2016.

The US call comes after Ukraine's acting prime minister proposed more powers for the country's eastern regions, where pro-Russian separatists are protesting against the government. Meanwhile, Washington on April 11 announced new sanctions targeting individuals directly involved in Russia's annexation of Crimea. The US Treasury Department said it had frozen the US assets of a former Ukrainian official, a Crimea-based energy company and six Crimean leaders, including the head of Crimea's election commission and the mayor of Sevastopol. 'Urgent measures' Mr Lew said the US was \"boosting the IMF's programme through an additional package, including a $1 billion loan guarantee and other forms of technical assistance.\" \"The international community - multilateral and bilateral development banks - need to take urgent steps to support the IMF's programme through financial assistance,\" he said. US Treasury Secretary calls Russia's annexation of Crimea \"illegal\" The IMF announced an $18 billion aid package last month to help Ukraine improve its economy. The total value of the package has so far reached $27 billion, with contributions from Europe and the United States. In return, the IMF has required Ukraine to cut government spending and raise taxes. Ukraine's economy has been hit hard by Russia's decision to stop selling gas at preferential prices. The price was agreed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in a deal before Yanukovych was ousted. At the time, Russia also announced it would buy $15 billion worth of Ukrainian government bonds. Separately, Ukraine's acting prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, offered more powers to the country's eastern regions on April 11. Yatsenyuk was in talks with local leaders in Donetsk, where protesters demanding autonomy have occupied a government building. The separatist protests in eastern Ukraine follow Russia's annexation of Crimea last month, which was the biggest political confrontation between Moscow and Europe since the Cold War. The IMF is also demanding that Ukraine strengthen its fight against corruption and end its central bank's support of the hryvnia. Ukraine's new government says it needs $35 billion to avoid default. Ukraine has also yet to pay off a $2.2 billion gas debt to Russia's Gazprom. European Union Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger told Australia's ORF that he was working on a plan to help Ukraine pay for gas imports and ensure its debts do not continue to rise. EU says it could reroute gas to Ukraine Gas supplies On April 11, President Putin reassured the EU that Russia would not cut off gas supplies. Brussels said it would support the new government in Kiev if the Kremlin threatened to cut off gas to Ukraine. \"I want to say once again: We have no intention of stopping gas deliveries to Ukraine,\" Putin said during a televised meeting of the Security Council, Reuters news agency reported. Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine in 2006 and 2009. The 2009 incident alone caused a two-week interruption of gas supplies to the EU via Ukraine. The EU and the United States have imposed new sanctions on Russian and Ukrainian officials in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea. The U.S. Treasury Department said the new sanctions target the U.S. assets of a former Ukrainian official, a Crimea-based energy company and six Crimean leaders, including the head of the election commission and the mayor of Sevastopol.

On the same day, the Quang Binh Department of Education and Training established a working group to work with the Quang Ninh District Education Department, Duy Ninh Secondary School as well as teacher Nguyen Thi Phuong Thuy (homeroom teacher of class 6.2). \"The working group will clarify whether Ms. Thuy previously punished other students like that or not,\" VnExpress quoted Mr. Dinh Quy Nhan, Director of the Quang Binh Department of Education and Training.

The student was slapped a total of 231 times (23 students each slapped 10 times) and the last person to slap her was teacher Thuy. Teacher Phuong Thuy admitted that she told the whole class that each student needed to \"slap their friend 10 times\" in the face, Lao Dong newspaper reported, but said she was not present to witness what happened because she was teaching another class. \"Because she was slapped so many times, the student's cheeks were swollen and purple.

{"instruction": "Please summarize the following in one sentence.\nGas cartel discussed\nThe informal organization, called the Gas Exporting Countries, includes Russia, Iran and Kazakhstan. Some of their leaders have expressed interest in forming an OPEC-like cartel to control gas production and prices. Gas accounts for about 20 percent of all energy used worldwide for heating, cooking and generating electricity. The conference is an informal gathering of the various member countries, which together hold 70 percent of the world's known gas reserves. Officials from the European Union, which is increasingly dependent on Russian gas, have expressed concern about the possibility of such a cartel. But many analysts are skeptical that such a cartel would work. Most gas trade is via regional pipelines, so it is not a global market like oil, which the group can control as it is a fuel that is transported mainly by sea. There are also long-term gas supply contracts – some as long as 30 years – which would be a constraint on any attempt to cut production to push up prices."}

Vietnamese forces were informed by China in advance about the intention of the group of 21 people to enter Vietnam and this group was \"arrested by Chinese authorities.\" Previously, a group of 16 people including 10 men, four women and two children attempted to enter Vietnam through Bac Phong Sinh border gate, Quang Ninh. A media source said language barriers were one of the reasons why members of the group robbed and opened fire, killing two Vietnamese border guards. Five Chinese people were also killed, which officials in Quang Ninh province told the BBC was because they jumped from a high floor of a border post. Four women in the group were wearing Muslim clothing and the group crossing into Vietnam are believed to be from the Uighur minority. 'Refugee status' Meanwhile, the Phnom Penh Post newspaper also reported that a group of Uighurs were arrested on Saturday in Thailand's Sa Kaeo province, which borders Cambodia. The newspaper said the group of 14 people abandoned by Cambodian traffickers included six children, three women and five men. They said they were on their way to Turkey, which has a large Uighur community. The Phnom Penh Post said violence between Uighurs and Han Chinese had increased in recent years, forcing the Uighurs to flee. They say the crackdown by Chinese authorities has made it impossible for them to live in their homeland. The Phnom Penh Post also reported that another group of 15 Uighurs were arrested in Sa Keo on March 23. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Bangkok said it had not been informed of the arrests.

The new tariffs replace temporary tariffs that expired on Thursday. \"The European Union's anti-dumping measures on Chinese leather shoes lack any legal or factual basis, and threaten the legitimate rights of Chinese companies,\" a spokesman for China's Ministry of Commerce said. He said Beijing would consider the situation but warned it had the right to \"take corresponding measures.\" The 25-nation bloc has been divided over how to satisfy both European shoemakers, who fear competition from Asia, and European retailers, who want access to cheap imports. Wednesday's compromise came after a hard-fought vote: 13 countries voted in favor, 12 opposed. Both Vietnam and China have denied the EU's accusations of dumping. An estimated half of the 2.5 billion pairs of shoes sold in the EU last year were made in China. However, only 174 million of these will be subject to the new tariffs. Vietnam imported fewer shoes - 265 million pairs - in 2005. Of these, 103 million will be subject to the new tariffs. A previous plan to impose a 7.5% tariff for five years was rejected by governments including Britain and Sweden on the grounds that it would harm retailers. Vietnam and China export hundreds of millions of pairs of shoes to Europe each year and have been growing rapidly. But earlier this year the EU decided to increase the tariffs, arguing that manufacturers in Vietnam and China receive government subsidies and are able to sell at unreasonably low prices. The European Commission says shoe production in the continent has fallen by 30% since 2001 and 40,000 jobs have been lost. European manufacturers say this threatens their jobs because they cannot compete with imported shoes. But many retailers support it because they can sell at better prices thanks to cheap buying."}

Beijing has imposed restrictions or tariffs on dairy, meat, wine and other products as political tensions have worsened. This has caused alarm in Australia, as China is its largest trading partner, accounting for nearly 40% of its exports. Earlier this week, Chinese state-controlled media reported that Australian thermal coal exports - the third-largest export to China - would face restrictions. Beijing declined to comment. China has previously accused Australia of being \"unfriendly\" and \"hostile\" towards it.

'Take it to arbitration' China's 80% tariff on barley - imposed in May - is the first Australian agricultural export to be penalised this year, and comes after Chinese trade officials alleged illegal dumping. The Australian government denies this and says its repeated requests to Beijing over trade strikes have been ignored. Speaking on Wednesday, Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said it was an \"appropriate next step\" for the country to take the issue to the global trade body. “We ask for independent arbitration to adjudicate and ultimately resolve those disputes,” Simon Birmingham said.

Last week, he accused China of undermining the two countries’ free trade agreement – ​​a 2015 deal that reduced tariffs and increased access to goods.

This is one of the reasons causing frustration for Dong Tam commune residents about land disputes. In 2014, the Hanoi Moi newspaper quoted My Duc district officials verifying that the reserve public land fund under the management of the My Duc district People's Committee left since 1993 was 27.7%, equivalent to 103 hectares, while the government's 2013 Land Law said that the reserve public land could not exceed 5%.

However, in 2005-2006, when Dong Tam commune organized the registration to implement the policy of land consolidation and surplus land exchange, only 12 households registered to convert public land but 11 households were officials or relatives of commune officials. VTC said at that time that many people refused to receive land because they did not agree with the land division. Meanwhile, VietnamNet and Tien Phong at the same period in 2014 recorded a series of commune officials owning thousands of square meters of land, with the case of Commune Party Secretary Nguyen Ngoc Son owning more than 2,000 square meters. The article 'In land consolidation, commune officials take all the 'golden land' by VietnamNet quoted Mr. Le Dinh Kinh saying that \"the owners of these thousands of square meters of land, these golden land plots are the key cadres of the commune.\" VTC made an investigative report on the current situation of the huge land fund in Dong Tam commune in 2014. This was also recorded by the Deputy Head of the Internal Affairs Committee of the Hanoi Party Committee on April 24, 2014 after receiving many complaints from the people. In a video clip recently posted online, Mr. Le Dinh Kinh, representative of Dong Tam commune, explained the land dispute to local leaders and representatives of Viettel, and Mr. Kinh said that he was the one who wrote the application allowing \"a person named Chanh\" to borrow the land.

However, when Mr. Chanh moved to Thai Binh in 1990, it is not clear why the Dong Tam Commune People's Committee did not take back the land but allowed Mr. Chanh to sell the borrowed land, according to Mr. Kinh. Hanoi Moi Newspaper also noted that at that time the People's Committee also allowed a person named Vien to use 12,000 m2 right on the front of Provincial Road 429 and in 2008 this person sold thousands of square meters to many other individuals and Mr. Vien continuously transferred thousands of square meters of land to other individuals and earned hundreds of billions of VND.

{"instruction": "Please summarize the following in one sentence.\n\nHow long will the 'Hun Sen dynasty' last?\nPrime Minister Hun Sen is one of Southeast Asia's longest-serving rulers This is Cambodia's fifth election since 1993. Eight parties are taking part, but it is essentially a two-horse race between Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and Sam Rainsy's Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP). Sam Rainsy ended his exile after Hun Sen asked the king for a pardon. But he was removed from the electoral register and cannot run as a candidate in the July 28 election. Advantages Hun Sen, who was a member of the Khmer Rouge before fleeing to Vietnam following an internal purge, has ruled Cambodia since the Khmer Rouge were overthrown in 1979. His CCP has built a powerful election machine and financial resources. They also have the advantage of a pliant media and an electoral system that is vulnerable to government interference. Prime Minister Hun Sen has said he wants to rule until he retires after he turns 70, and has promoted his three sons in the party and military. The youngest, Hun Many, 30, is running for parliament for the first time and is leading the national student movement. The second son, General Hun Manith, is deputy head of the military intelligence unit. Notably, Hun Sen’s eldest and most beloved son, General Hun Manet, is deputy commander of his father’s bodyguards and head of the national counterterrorism unit. “They are just like the old generation, only more educated,” said Henri Locard, a French historian at the Royal University of Phnom Penh. “If things continue as they are now, you will never see the end of Hun Sen.” A CPP lawmaker, Sok Eysan, denied that Hun Sen favours his sons. “The party has a policy of promoting the role of youth, including some who have studied in the West and domestically.” “We care about all of them, the youth are the next generation,” he said. Opposition looks forward to Sam Rainsy’s return but cannot run The CNRP, which merged with the opposition last year, is hoping to win more than the 29 seats it won in the 2008 election. The CNRP is buoyed by the return of its leader, Sam Rainsy, despite being unable to run. Under Hun Sen, Cambodia has transformed from a war-torn country into one of Southeast Asia’s fastest-growing economies. But growth has come with social tensions in a country where a third of the population still lives on 65 US cents a day. In rural areas, traditionally the CPP’s support base, there is growing anger over land being given to foreign companies and profits for Hun Sen’s allies. One 61-year-old farmer, Om Vanthoeun, told Reuters he was concerned about land grabs and what he saw as a wave of immigration from Vietnam. “I just want change, even babies want change,” he said, adding that he planned to vote for the opposition. Some say the opposition could win enough seats to force Hun Sen into a coalition government. But most analysts believe the CPP will retain its majority, albeit with fewer than its current 90 seats in the 123-seat National Assembly. “The CPP is almost certain to have a majority in parliament, which will provide policy continuity and basic political stability for foreign investors,” said Giulia Zino, an analyst at consultancy Control Risks in Singapore."}

He also reiterated that Iran's nuclear program was purely for peaceful purposes. Timing of the announcement Many experts feel it was only a matter of time before Iran made such an announcement. Iran has been determined to press ahead with its nuclear program since last summer, despite calls from the IAEA, then the United States and the Security Council to stop enriching uranium. The timing of the announcement is significant because it comes just ahead of a visit to Iran by IAEA Director General Mohammad ElBaradei. ElBaradei is expected to prepare a report to the Security Council later this month on whether Iran has complied with the council's call. IAEA officials said last week that Mr ElBaradei hoped for positive results from his upcoming trip to Iran. But the latest statement suggests he is likely to receive a defiant response from a country that continues to insist on its right to enrich uranium on its soil. Iranian officials may hope to use this to bolster future nuclear talks. But there are likely to be further calls from countries skeptical of Iran’s nuclear intentions for the Security Council to take a tough stance when it considers the issue in the coming weeks."}

News of Chairman Mao's death quickly spread throughout Beijing. Many people wore black armbands. They gathered in groups in front of Mao's giant portrait at the entrance to the Forbidden City. State officials have paid tribute to Chairman Mao's role in the struggle against \"enemies\" within the Chinese Communist Party, which he co-founded in 1921. He was instrumental in leading communist forces on the 6,000-mile \"Long March\" to Shaanxi in northern China to escape attacks by the Kuomintang in the mid-1930s. In 1949, he became chairman of the newly formed People's Republic of China. In the 1950s, Chairman Mao launched the Great Leap Forward, which increased industrial production by mobilizing a huge labor force to the countryside. After stepping down as chairman, he continued to influence the country's policies as chairman of the Communist Party. The Cultural Revolution was launched in 1966. Schools were closed. Students joined the Red Guards in the ideological crusade. Many officials lost their jobs, were tortured and killed during the revolution.

When I was 6 years old, I had just finished 1st grade so I was very eager to learn to read. By chance, I saw a newspaper (I think it was Tuoi Tre Chu Nhat) with a picture of many people on a ship with a big headline: \"Traitors\", I took it around the house to ask what \"traitor\" was but no one answered me. I read the story \"Muc Trien Lien's filial piety\" and wondered how to go to hell.

{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content into one sentence.\nThree challenges for global health in 2017\n1. How can we fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria? More efforts are needed to improve the detection, treatment, and prevention of bacteria causing infections resistant to antibiotics. We need to accelerate the development of new antibiotics to replace those that are no longer effective in order to protect people from life-threatening infections. Five key figures for the next 100 years of health: What kind of milk prevents spoilage every month? What food helps fight insomnia? The medicine of today often depends on the effectiveness of drugs prescribed by doctors. However, many infections are becoming increasingly difficult to treat because bacteria are becoming resistant to the existing antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a serious threat to our health and are currently causing 700,000 deaths worldwide each year. In just one generation, this number could rise to 10 million. This means that we may lose the ability to safely perform not only complex life-saving procedures like chemotherapy and organ transplants, but even simple surgeries like hip replacements. -- Tim Jinks, head of the antibiotic resistance research agency at the Wellcome Trust.\n2. How can we cope with global epidemics? Increasing international travel, urbanization, and climate change could cause bacteria to spread from one country to another much faster than before. It is important to develop vaccines to be ready for global epidemics, whether Zika, Ebola, or any new epidemic. Recent epidemics like SARS, Ebola, and Zika have shown us how unprepared humanity is for such outbreaks. To counter this threat, we need new vaccines, strengthened healthcare systems, and better coordination between countries. At Wellcome, we are working on addressing this threat in various ways; we co-founded the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which will help develop new vaccines against infection-causing bacteria that we believe could cause a pandemic. The World Health Organization also needs a larger budget and must be responsible for responding quickly and effectively when an outbreak starts to spread. Only through investment, coordination, and cooperation can we prepare the world for the next pandemic. -- Mike Turner, head of infectious disease and antibiotic resistance research at Wellcome Trust. First, many countries have inadequate national health services that are not equipped to detect and deal with large-scale epidemics. Second, we lack sufficient vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic methods for diseases that could spread widely. Third, at the international level, we lack a dynamic, cooperative approach to strengthen the essential elements for preparing and responding, such as increasing the ability to produce vaccines in emergencies, establishing a global surveillance system, or forming rapid-response units. Coordinating solutions to these three issues must be a top priority if we want to cope with the next pandemic. The World Bank estimates that if humanity faces a pandemic like the Spanish flu of 1918, the world will suffer 71 million deaths and a global crisis with total losses exceeding $3 trillion. -- Gavin Yamey, Professor of Global Health, Duke Global Health Institute. Recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika have shown our vulnerabilities to bacterial threats. They also highlight the need for preparedness before an epidemic breaks out and an effective response once it does. However, these outbreaks have also demonstrated the potential for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases using new technologies. This is the moment when we can either prevent or face the devastating consequences of one of the greatest challenges of our time. -- Pardis Sabeti, Associate Professor of Biology, Evolutionary Biology, Immunology, and Infectious Diseases at Harvard University.\n3. How can we extend average life expectancy? Recent studies show that health outcomes in relation to healthcare spending can help predict several health indicators, such as life expectancy, infant mortality, and maternal mortality. While genetic factors and healthcare services can have an impact on these indicators, social and environmental factors have a much greater influence. Some investments in social services like job training, housing support, and nutrition assistance are currently not receiving enough attention. -- Elizabeth Bradley, Professor at the Yale School of Public Health. These are three of the 12 big questions humanity faces in 2017. Other questions include: An article published on BBC Future."}
{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content in one sentence.\nComparing the South China Sea and Aegean Sea disputes\nSimilar precedents In the history of maritime sovereignty and air defense identification zone disputes, perhaps the most typical and recent case, still unresolved, is the Aegean Sea dispute, between two NATO member states: Greece and Turkey. This dispute, which lasted from the 1970s and nearly led to war in 1987 and 1996, was over maritime sovereignty. From there, the dispute involved the exclusive economic zone, airspace sovereignty and flight information region due to a series of small islands under Greek sovereignty (internationally recognized) scattered along the western coast of Türkiye. At the same time, Türkiye also claims sovereignty in the “gray zone” (area of ​​unclear sovereignty) with a series of other small islands, also scattered in the Aegean Sea, and argues that the Chicago Convention on Air Navigation only relates to civil flights, not military flights. It is not difficult to realize that the nature of the dispute in the East Sea is much more complicated and tense, because the incident involves many countries, not just between two neighboring countries. Just like the incident that just happened, when China tested flights on the artificial runway of Da Chu Thap, an area that both Vietnam and the Philippines claim sovereignty over, while China unilaterally claims sovereignty over the entire East Sea, more than 1.35 million square miles. China is renovating islands and building runways on disputed reefs in the East Sea. By unilaterally landing civilian aircraft and putting into operation an airport with a runway of more than 3 km, China is \"imposing\" sovereignty on a disputed area because no one understands what the airport's code will be according to civil aviation law as prescribed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and what the flight numbers will be. Perhaps China will soon declare control of international flights over this area in the future, and in addition to civilian flights, if China conducts military flights, what will happen to the security situation in the region? From the Aegean Sea to the South China Sea The Aegean Sea is also a route used by many migrants and refugees to travel from Türkiye to Greece. Although the Aegean dispute remains unresolved, after more than 50 meetings between the Foreign Ministers of the two countries, Greece and Türkiye have essentially agreed to leave the unresolved disputes to the International Court of Justice (IJC). In addition, NATO and the EU have proposed a dispute resolution process, in which steps are taken jointly towards the acceptance of the role of the International Court of Justice by both countries, while each country unilaterally stops activities that cause tension. For example, Turkey must not fly over disputed islands or, like Greece, must comply with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) regarding Turkey's right to use the common sea. Since 2011, although the Aegean dispute has not been resolved, with both countries being NATO allies and Türkiye still applying for EU membership, a happy ending is something that can be seen. However, it will not be feasible to apply the above solution to the East Sea dispute for many reasons, the most important of which is China's attitude and the role of an international organization of sufficient stature to bring the countries involved to the negotiating table. It is easy to see China's ambition, first to become the hegemon in Asia, then to reach out to the world as a new political force, and controlling the East Sea is one of the important steps. The question is whether the US has the ability and determination to contain the rise of this most populous country. In addition, unlike the Aegean dispute that only occurs between two countries, the East Sea dispute involves a series of countries in the region such as China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei, so finding a consensus solution for all is an extremely difficult problem. Not to mention that China does not accept multilateral negotiations but only agrees to bilateral agreements with different countries. The spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry has spoken out about the test flight to Truong Sa. And the most crucial point is that the Obama administration has launched a \"pivot\" policy towards Asia but decided to cut the budget of the Pacific Fleet, making China more determined to use force to monopolize the East Sea. It is not known whether the US-China relationship will develop in a good or bad direction, but certainly the new US administration after this year's election must have a different policy towards China if it does not want the region with annual maritime trade of up to 5 trillion USD to become unstable, threatening the security and peace of the entire region.

Xinhua reported on July 26 that Gu Kailai and a family aide have been charged with the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood. A lawyer for her family said the trial could take place in August. However, dealing with Bo, who is still awaiting Communist Party discipline, is much more difficult because he is believed to still have many supporters. Reuters' analysis on July 27 said the Bo Xilai trial is complicated for Beijing because it exposes divisions within the party. Bo has leftist support because of his policies in Chongqing aimed at reducing the gap between rich and poor. The case comes as Beijing has yet to complete a leadership transition that initially appeared to have Mr. Bo on the verge of being promoted. Wang Zhengxu, a researcher at the University of Nottingham in Britain, believes Beijing will bide its time, possibly until after the 18th Party Congress, which is scheduled for later this year. “They won’t have a formal conclusion on Bo Xilai before the congress.” “They may announce that Mr. Bo will be expelled from the Party, but the formal prosecution will come later,” he said. Xinhua said Gu Kailai, along with her aide, Zhang Xiaojun, were indicted by the Hefei City People’s Procuratorate in Anhui province. Prosecutors said the former Politburo member’s wife and son had a conflict with Neil Heywood over economic interests, according to the state news agency. Gu was accused of “poisoning and killing” Neil Heywood with Zhang Xiaojun. Another China expert, Susan L.

In just the first 10 minutes of the match, the red team created at least 3 scoring opportunities and received 4 corner kicks. Vietnam Olympic's attacking situations showed a clear \"playbook\" with the main direction of the ball on the right wing thanks to the good passing ability of central defender Duy Manh and the understanding of the duo Van Thanh - Cong Phuong. The two goals scored by Quang Hai and Van Quyet in the first half were the inevitable result of the comprehensive dominance of Vietnam Olympic team. In the second half, although coach Park Hang-seo made some changes, Olympic Vietnam still proved to be too strong for Pakistan. The fact that Cong Phuong only scored one more goal was still small compared to the countless opportunities created by this player and his teammates. Psychological bright spot There were concerns that the U23 Asia effect or the recent scandal related to the training ground in Indonesia would affect the players' psychology, which has long been considered an \"incurable disease\" of Vietnamese football. However, the performance of Quang Hai and his teammates against Pakistan dispelled those concerns. Not necessarily in terms of playing style or results, but the mentality of Olympic Vietnam was the biggest bright spot in the match against Pakistan in particular as well as throughout the matches under coach Park Hang-seo in general. Quang Hai - Cong Phuong shines The 3-0 victory of Olympic Vietnam against Pakistan left a strong impression on the duo Cong Phuong - Quang Hai. If Cong Phuong contributed 1 goal and 1 assist, Quang Hai also left a strong impression with the opening goal and sharp attacking situations on the day when he was pulled down to play as a central midfielder with Xuan Truong. It was also from a beautiful passing situation of this duo that helped Olympic Vietnam score the opening goal of the match. Although coach Park Hang-seo has experimented a lot, Quang Hai and Cong Phuong will still be the key links on the attacking front of Olympic Vietnam at ASIAD this year. Jakabaring Stadium in Palembang city, Indonesia is ready to welcome athletes participating in Asiad 2018. Weaknesses In fact, Pakistan's performance was relatively disappointing compared to expectations before the ball rolled when they were considered the \"unknown\" of Group D. Against such a weak opponent, Olympic Vietnam still has things to improve and some weaknesses to overcome. In defense, center-back Dinh Trong sometimes made careless moves, creating opportunities for Pakistan to threaten Tien Dung's goal. Player number 21 needs to play safer and simpler football if he is trusted in the upcoming matches. Meanwhile, the ability to take advantage of opportunities by the Vietnamese Olympic team's attack will be a headache for coach Park Hang-seo. Obviously, the score of 3-0 is still modest compared to the number of opportunities created by the Vietnamese Olympic team, in which only Cong Phuong missed two unbelievable penalties. Set-piece situations were also not well exploited by coach Park Hang-seo's students in this match. Remember, during the preparation period before the tournament, the Korean coach worked hard to train his players to arrange corner kicks similar to the England team at the 2018 World Cup. However, this arrangement was still not effective against Pakistan when the Vietnamese Olympic team was awarded many corner kicks but did not create any clear scoring opportunities. In addition, the poor performance of seniors like Van Quyet or Anh Duc is also an issue that the coaching staff needs to pay attention to after the match against Pakistan. If Van Quyet takes too much time to handle situations, leading to slowing down the attack, it seems that Anh Duc is still not really \"in sync\" with juniors like Cong Phuong and Van Thanh. Vietnam Olympic Team will have another match that is considered easy against Nepal to overcome the above weaknesses before meeting Japan in the final round - a match that will most likely decide how far Vietnam Olympic Team will go in Indonesia."}

'Editors must let journalists speak' 'There must be more space to regulate the press' Experience of '50 years of journalism on both sides' Mr Trump has derided press reports as \"fake news\" and attacked reporters as \"enemies of the people\". UN experts say this raises the risk of violence against reporters. The Boston Globe pledged to write an editorial \"on the dangers of government attacks on the press\" on August 16, and asked other newspapers to do the same. The call has received a positive response, with the initial 100 news organizations now growing to nearly 350, including major national US newspapers and smaller, local papers, supporting it, alongside major international publications such as the British newspaper The Guardian. President Trump has been accused of increasing the risk of violent attacks against journalists. What are the newspapers saying? One other newspaper that has joined the campaign is the Topeka Capital-Journal, which wrote of Trump's attacks on the media: \"It's evil. It's destructive. And it has to stop now.\" The paper was one of the few to endorse Trump in 2016. The fact that Trump won without media support has raised questions about whether the Globe's campaign has actually eroded support for him. There have also been some dissenting voices to the Globe's campaign. Tom Tradup of the conservative website Townhall.com called the Globe's campaign \"a pathetic attempt to appear relevant.\" The Wall Street Journal did not participate in the campaign. What do Americans think? A Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday found that 51% of Republicans now believe the news media is \"the enemy of the people rather than an important part of democracy,\" and 52% of Republicans surveyed were not concerned that Mr. Trump's criticism could lead to violence against reporters. Among all voters, 65% believe the news is an important part of democracy, the poll found. An Ipsos poll conducted this month found similar results. Additionally, the poll found that 23% of Republicans, and about one in eight American voters overall, believe that Mr. Trump should shut down major mainstream media outlets like CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times."}

Dozens of Lenin images crowd the brick wall of an exhibition in Hungary's capital, Budapest. A bust of the late communist leader looks up from its position in the corner of the room. Another painting shows a Russian soldier joyfully holding a rifle in one hand and embracing a girl with children around them. These are just a few of the many artworks now brought back after being stored in basements and other storage rooms in old government buildings since 1990. The paintings, photographs, and sculptures, a legacy of Hungary's communist era, will be auctioned to raise funds for those affected by the toxic red sludge bauxite spill in October. Dusting off many paintings and sculptures of the late communist leader Lenin had been displayed in Hungary before. A Hungarian government press release regarding the auction states: \"We show that even the most useless objects can be used for a useful purpose.\" Most of Hungary's communist-themed artworks were removed after the collapse of the communist regime in 1989. \"These paintings and statues have gathered dust for 20 years,\" said Bence Retvari, a parliamentary secretary and official from Hungary's Ministry of Justice. \"The state no longer wants to care for the remnants of communist ideology.\" Displayed for the first time in 20 years, 230 artifacts are now waiting for potential buyers at Pinter Gallery in Budapest. \"The upcoming auction has generated a lot of interest,\" Anna Losonci, a representative from Gallery Pinter, told BBC World. \"We have received a lot of attention from collectors here and abroad.\" The government expects the buyers to include businesspeople, students, and serious collectors from Hungary, Poland, the Netherlands, and even places as far as the United States. Starting prices for the items range from around $5 for a Lenin print from the 1970s to nearly $1,500 for an oil painting called \"Soviet-Hungarian Friendship.\" Organizers at the gallery hope bidders will push the prices higher, potentially bringing some of the artifacts into a museum. Never again Hungary, famous for many other art movements, will hold an auction called \"Never Again! Third Edition\" on December 6. Forgacs Gergely from Gallery Pinter said the title is a pun. He explained: \"It’s a phrase used by an auctioneer in Hungary when they hammer down their gavel, but it also represents our hope here in Hungary that we will never return to communism.\" This spirit can also be seen in the logos used in the online auction catalog, which shows an image of Lenin with a hammer over his head. Literally, this could mean Lenin is being auctioned off. \"People enjoy art in different ways,\" Losonci said. She added that for some, this may evoke nostalgia, while for others, it may bring back unpleasant memories. A member working for the Hungarian government, who requested anonymity, told the BBC: \"I’m in my 20s, and I grew up in a completely different era. But some older Hungarians may see this art as a symbol of the communist regime. They still have memories of it. When they see a painting of Lenin, it may remind them of the portraits of him in every classroom when they were young.\" Despite the serious and historical significance of the artworks, the organizers are introducing some lighthearted, youthful elements to the auction process. The auction will be hosted by two young Hungarians dressed as cartoon characters, aiming to assist those affected by the red sludge disaster. \"We hope this will make it a more relaxed and enjoyable event,\" said Anna Losonci. \"But we will respect the artifacts and the people who lived through that time.\" Toxic chemicals The red sludge spill disaster occurred just two months ago. All the proceeds from the auction will be donated to the Catholic charity Caritas, which will use the funds to help people in towns affected by the toxic sludge spill. Hungary had previously declared a state of emergency after a reservoir at an alumina factory broke, releasing a chemical waste flow. The disaster resulted in many deaths and over 100 injuries, with estimates indicating that it will take at least a year to cleanse the damage. Hungarian government estimates suggest the country will spend tens of millions of dollars to address the consequences of the chemical leak disaster."}

The meeting took place amid a significant increase in cases across Asia over the past week. The spread of the epidemic in neighboring countries like Thailand, Laos, and especially Cambodia is causing concern in Vietnam. Illegal entrants infected with Covid-19 raise fears in Vietnam as authorities struggle to find loopholes. Mr. Vu Duc Dam emphasized the threat of illegal border crossings: 'We cannot rule out cases of illegal border crossings. If they attend crowded events or go to bus stations, airports without wearing masks, the risk is incalculable.' He also suggested that provinces along the southwestern border increase border control. 'After a long period without community transmission, there could be complacency, so strict control is necessary. Illegal entrants who deliberately do not declare must be strictly dealt with,' Mr. Dam said. Earlier, Vietnam had also tightened its borders, especially after the Ministry of Health reported that two illegal entrants in An Phu District (An Giang) tested positive for Covid-19 on April 15. How are neighboring countries handling the situation? In Cambodia, Phnom Penh and Takhmao, the capital of Kandal Province near the Vietnam border, have been under lockdown from 00:00 on April 15 to April 28. The government of Southwestern Cambodia has announced a 14-day lockdown in the city from 00:00 on April 23 to May 6. Residents in these locked-down areas are banned from leaving their homes except for emergencies. All public gatherings are prohibited. Going out to buy food is still allowed but limited to three times a week, and only two members per household are allowed to go shopping. Covid: Cambodia's vaccination is good, but infections are increasing. Vietnam is concerned about the outbreak in Cambodia. The Cambodian Ministry of Health reported 446 new cases on April 22, all community transmissions, with the majority in Phnom Penh. The World Health Organization (WHO) representative Li Ailan warned that Cambodia is 'on the verge of a national disaster' due to Covid-19 and that its healthcare system 'is at risk of collapse, and the consequences will be catastrophic if this outbreak is not stopped.' The strong outbreak in Cambodia is causing concern for Vietnam, which shares a land border of over 1,100 km, in addition to a maritime border in the Gulf of Thailand where ships can easily cross. Recently, Vietnamese authorities have apprehended many people smuggled from Cambodia into Vietnam by land and sea. On April 22, the Thai government reported 1,470 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours. Notably, the death toll in the country rose by 7, the highest number so far in this wave. Thai authorities also reported that while this third wave of the epidemic has a higher transmission rate than previous waves, the death rate is still lower. Bangkok continues to have the highest number of new Covid-19 cases, with 365 cases. Vietnam: The Ministry of Health warns about the fourth wave of the epidemic. How did 'overreaction' help Vietnam successfully combat the virus? In Laos, the situation shows signs of improvement but with complicated cases. Specifically, except for the case in Savannakhet, who came from Thailand and was isolated immediately upon entry, all four cases in Vientiane and one in Bokeo were community transmissions, all with complex travel histories and many contacts. The Lao government has implemented a lockdown in Vientiane from April 22 to May 5. Additionally, several localities in Laos have deployed forces and strong measures to prevent illegal entries bringing Covid-19, especially across the Mekong River from Thailand. Vietnam offers assistance to Cambodia. According to Nhan Dan newspaper, Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh Long held an online meeting with Cambodian Minister of Health Mam Buncheng on April 22 to share Covid-19 prevention and control experiences. Mr. Long also mentioned that the Vietnamese government had mobilized domestic resources to support Cambodia with 800 ventilators, two million medical masks, 300,000 N95 masks, and other medical equipment. Will illegal entrants break through Vietnam's epidemic prevention line? The Minister of Health indicated that if Cambodia agrees, the Vietnamese Ministry of Health will arrange to transport the supplies to Cambodia as soon as possible, potentially by this Saturday, with a Vietnamese airline flying from Tan Son Nhat Airport to Phnom Penh Airport. At Cambodia's request, since March, the Vietnamese Embassy in Cambodia has cooperated with Cambodia's Immigration Department to expedite the legal procedures for the repatriation of Vietnamese citizens after they recover from the disease. On the morning of April 23, the Ministry of Health reported that there were 8 new Covid-19 cases among people who entered Vietnam and were quarantined in Ho Chi Minh City and Nam Dinh. Vietnam has not recorded any community transmission cases for nearly a month. Currently, Vietnam has 2,826 Covid-19 patients, and 128,610 Vietnamese people have received the Covid-19 vaccine."}

In general, countries with high expectations for the national economy tend to say that life today is better than in the past. For example, in Vietnam, up to 91% of respondents said economic conditions were better than half a century ago. Countries with a \"rosy\" view of life ranked after Vietnam are India (69%), South Korea (68%) and Japan (65%). While the Asia Pacific region has many countries with an optimistic outlook, the Philippines is a place where only 43% say their lives are better now than before. Many statistics show that Vietnam ranks quite high in the world in terms of happiness. \"That's because 50 years ago Vietnam was engulfed in war and its economy was not as strong as it is today. \"So it's understandable that countries like Vietnam and South Korea, which were not economically prosperous or suffered from conflict, are the ones that feel life is better today,\" said Jacob Poushter from the Pew Research Center.

According to this source, \"The Hanoi Party Committee has established 886 party organizations (TCĐ) in various types of non-state enterprises\" during the above period. The number of additional Communist Party members admitted from enterprises in the past 5 years is 5,964 in Hanoi, including 24 private enterprise owners. John Kerry: 'There is only capitalism' in Vietnam The Capital Security page quoted the Head of the Central Organizing Committee Pham Minh Chinh as highly appreciating the fact that the 15th Hanoi Party Committee Standing Committee has issued Resolution 09 on building and developing the Communist Party's base in the non-state economic sector. Doing and groping at the same time But Mr. Pham Minh Chinh also admitted that this is a new task, \"requiring doing, groping, and learning from experience to improve\". According to him, businesses \"must see the benefits for them to support, actively and responsibly implement this policy\". It seems that China has gone ahead of Vietnam in implementing this goal, especially in coastal areas with many private enterprises. In the article Where's The Party?, the British newspaper, The Economist (January 28, 2012) pointed out that China has a policy with the same name as what the Vietnamese press is currently stating. That is the goal of \"Party Construction in Non-State-Owned Enterprises\" which was proposed in the form of a proper newspaper. According to the article, the whole story points out a fundamental contradiction for the Communist Party in China. In the late 1990s, thousands of factories and enterprises in China had to close down due to business losses, destroying the Party cells within them. Job market in China: the country's economy no longer operates according to the communist model. The Chinese economy then had nothing \"communist\" but the Communist Party tried to set foot in private enterprises. In 1999, only 3% of private enterprises had Party cells. But by 2012, according to The Economist, this number was 13%. Currently, many large Chinese enterprises in the telecommunications industry have Party cells and many National Assembly deputies are dollar billionaires. In Vietnam, Nhan Dan newspaper quoted a Communist Party official as saying that increasing the number of Party branches in the private economic sector has made progress in Hanoi, but overall there are still many \"difficulties and challenges\". The 'theoretical crisis' of the Communist Party of Vietnam Hanoi Secretary Hoang Trung Hai was quoted as saying that there are difficulties because \"in the current context, it is very large when the number of enterprises in the non-state sector is increasing rapidly\". \"And in these enterprises, there are more and more small and medium enterprises (accounting for 90%)\". In October 2016, then US Secretary of State John Kerry commented that there is only \"crazy capitalism\" left in Vietnam. In China, only enterprises with 80 or more employees are encouraged to have Party branches. The British newspaper's article also said that the Chinese Communist Party has problems when it wants to develop their bases in foreign-owned enterprises. While in state-owned enterprises, Party officials control the work of employees, in private enterprises, and especially in foreign companies, their role is less clear. In Shanghai, the only thing Chinese Party members could do at a British company was write a letter to the board of directors in London asking not to close its Chinese operations when the company ran into financial difficulties, according to The Economist.

Mr ElBaradei said he hoped to persuade Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment until \"the outstanding issues are resolved\". There has been growing international criticism of Iran's announcement on Tuesday that it had succeeded in enriching uranium. The Iranian president insists Iran's nuclear ambitions are entirely peaceful. Mr ElBaradei will report to the UN Security Council later this month on whether Iran can comply with the request and end its enrichment activities by April 28. Otherwise Iran could be isolated. When he arrived in Tehran, Mr ElBaradei said he was looking for \"more active cooperation\" between Iran and the IAEA. He said he wanted to discuss \"how to re-align Iran\" with the international community's demands that it stop enriching uranium and take \"confidence-building measures\". No atomic bomb The International Institute for Strategic Studies estimates that Iran will need three to five years to have enough material to make a nuclear bomb. Iran's deputy nuclear chief Mohammad Saeedi said Iran plans to move toward high-level uranium enrichment with 54,000 centrifuges.

The number of workers is part of a proposal made by the management board of the economic zone in Ha Tinh province, central Vietnam, on August 22, according to VOV radio. Earlier, on July 29, Formosa Ha Tinh Company also proposed to the People's Committee of Ha Tinh province to allow contractors for 28 packages to recruit 8,426 foreign workers, VOV reported. VnExpress news website on September 6 stated that the newly hired workers are mainly \"managers, specialists, technicians, and construction site supervisors.\" The wave of protests leading to riots in the Vung Ang industrial zone in May caused many foreign facilities to be destroyed, and thousands of Chinese workers returned to their home country. In an interview last week with a Vietnamese newspaper, Mr. Vuong Van Tuong, Deputy Director of Formosa Ha Tinh, said on August 31 that before the May riots, Formosa Ha Tinh had 26,000 workers at construction sites, including 5,000 Chinese. He also said that the proposal to hire more than 8,400 foreign workers is to return production activities to \"normal.\" \"In August, Formosa requested contractors to survey how many workers are needed at each stage, especially Chinese workers... The results showed that about 8,400 Chinese workers are expected,\" said Mr. Tuong. At the end of August, local media reported that 30 contractors working on Formosa's project packages requested to hire nearly 11,000 foreign workers for the project, with \"over 90% of the nearly 11,000 new workers being Chinese.\" However, during a regular government press conference on Thursday, August 28, Deputy Minister of Labor, War Invalids, and Social Affairs Nguyen Trong Dam denied the figure of 10,000 Chinese workers. He said this was a request from 29 contractors, but as of August 27, the Ha Tinh Provincial People's Committee \"had only officially accepted 2,063 positions according to regulations.\" \"Currently, the contractors are proposing an additional 2,700 new positions in the near future, but they have not been approved yet.\" Can’t replace? Some say Vietnam should learn from China in exporting unskilled labor to neighboring countries. Some contractors say they need to hire \"specialists with high technical qualifications, experience, proficiency in work, and foreign languages,\" so despite wide announcements for months, they have not been able to recruit Vietnamese workers. Mr. Vuong Van Tuong, in an interview with VnExpress, said \"Formosa really wants to hire local workers to reduce costs,\" but also emphasized that \"for a blast furnace project like Formosa's, Vietnamese workers currently cannot do the job.\" \"Some other smaller domestic steel projects still need to hire foreign workers,\" he said. \"Formosa is a project won by Taiwanese contractors, but they still have to hire Chinese workers. If we were to replace them with Korean workers, it would take about six months for them to read the blueprints, and we would also have to consider costs. Therefore, we cannot stop hiring Chinese workers yet.\" However, public opinion and observers in Vietnam also raise the question of whether contractors truly cannot replace foreign workers with Vietnamese workers. In an online discussion between BBC and experts and observers on the topic of the majority of Chinese workers and immigrants in Vietnam this week, on Thursday, September 4, Dr. Tran Tuan, Director of the Center for Research and Training on Community Development (RTCCD) under the Vietnam Union of Science and Technology Associations, stated: \"This is a flat world, clearly when China wins the contract, they bring their workforce from China to Vietnam. The question of whether this workforce from China is skilled, technically qualified, or has the appropriate knowledge depends on how the leaders of those economic zones assess it. \"I think so far, there has been no research indicating the qualifications of Chinese migrant workers in Vietnam, and what specific technical skills they have. \"As for the statement by a provincial leader that these workers provide the skills that are lacking in Vietnam, I think this is more of an individual opinion. We need an objective report or study to provide concrete data.\" 'Policy paradox' Another researcher, Professor Tran Ngoc Them, from the University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Ho Chi Minh City, also mentioned in the online seminar with BBC on Thursday that there is a paradox in Vietnam's foreign labor import policy. He said: \"Normally, the flow of unskilled labor is from poorer countries to higher-income countries. However, in our case, it's the opposite. \"China has a higher average income than we do. In other countries, they usually solve employment problems for their own people. \"In our case, we need to export unskilled labor, while we are accepting unskilled labor from China,\" Professor Them said in his interview with BBC."}

On September 24, the two presidential candidates disagreed on whether to postpone the televised debate because of the economic turmoil. McCain said he was suspending his campaign to help address the crisis, while Obama said voters now wanted to hear from the candidates more than ever. In a joint statement, the two candidates said all parties needed to work together to avoid an “economic catastrophe.” ‘A disturbing scenario’ In his evening address to the nation, Bush said that significant parts of the US financial system were at risk of shutting down. And without action, a “disturbing scenario” is unfolding. The Bush administration has called on Congress to pass a massive package of public funds that the Treasury Department would use to buy up bad debt from financial institutions to stem the crisis. But lawmakers from both the Democratic and Republican parties are skeptical. Lawmakers say they want assurances that the plan will benefit American homeowners as well as Wall Street. Some have gone further, calling the plan a waste of public money. Bush said he understands the anger of “responsible Americans” who are “reluctant to pay the price for Wall Street’s excesses.” “But as things stand, if we don’t pass this proposal now, the American people will suffer much more later,” he said."}

In an article published on a number of international English-language websites on the same day, former Philippine President Fidel Ramos reiterated the reality of the lack of an institutional solution for the sea area, which he said \"the risk of conflict increases every day\". Recalling the incidents in which he said China repeatedly violated the Philippines' territorial waters and airspace off Palawan, Mr. Ramos asked whether a conflict would break out, with \"the Philippines and Vietnam\" on one side and China on the other? The former Philippine leader also recalled that in 1994, when Mr. Le Duc Anh was the president of Vietnam, the rotating leader of ASEAN, Mr. Ramos proposed to ASEAN that the Spratly Islands should be demilitarized to create trust. The former Philippine President made clear that the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS, must be used as a basis to resolve all differences in the control and exploitation of surrounding waters. 'Trust' Referring to the statements at the Boao and Hainan forums by Chinese leaders about the need to maintain peace in the East Sea, which the English version of Mr. Ramos' article calls the South China Sea, the author said he believed that \"Chinese leaders spoke as if they also wanted peace\". Mr. Ramos also believed that the US and Vietnamese governments both wanted stability and peace in this sea area. Mr. Fidel Famos was concerned about the increasing tensions in the East Sea. Therefore, he proposed the establishment of the Asia-Pacific bloc, or Pact Asia-Pacifica, to serve as a framework for joint negotiations on the dispute. This means that Mr. Ramos wants the United States to be present in the region, and does not agree with bilateral negotiations. To talk about the need to build trust, especially with China, the former Philippine leader also told a story. He said that in June this year, he gave a speech to 5,000 Filipino guests and Chinese officials on the occasion of Friendship Day between the two countries, the 36th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. But on the same day, he wrote, major headlines in the Chinese press did not spare words in attacking the Philippines for asserting sovereignty over the Spratlys. According to Mr. Ramos, with the current tension, the story of the South China Sea \"will almost certainly occupy the center of the agenda of the ASEAN Forum in Bali\" next week. 'Serious consequences' Returning to the Asia-Pacific Pact, Mr. Ramos said the United States should be welcomed, and that this Asia-Pacific bloc could play a role in replacing the American Pact Americana in the next 5-10 years. Although the article did not mention the China bloc - Pact Sinica - as some circles have mentioned, Mr. Ramos presented a vision of a larger, more inclusive trans-Pacific region, with China on one side, the United States on the other and ASEAN countries in the middle. It seems that Mr. Ramos wanted to talk about the goal of avoiding the \"balance of power\" situation that many scholars refer to as the US-China game to establish a \"burden-sharing\" mechanism. Two guided-missile destroyers anchored during the exercise at a military port in the Philippines in June 2011. There has been no reaction to Mr. Fidel V. Ramos's initiative, which wants to create a step to open a multilateral, inter-regional forum to have a mechanism to resolve maritime disputes. On the same day, July 17, regional newspapers republished an article in the Jakarta Post by Mr. Bambang Hartadi Nurgono, a researcher at the University of Indonesia, raising the need to bring China into multilateral discussions with ASEAN on islands. But just yesterday, July 16, China Daily in its Opinion section published an article by author Wang Hui strongly criticizing neighboring countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam for \"threatening China\". Without mentioning China's recent activities in the Southeast Asian sea, which have caused protests in Vietnam and the Philippines, the author only said that China has a long-standing historical basis for sovereignty here, as those countries are conducting military activities with the United States, causing tension. The article, whose \"opinions do not necessarily coincide with the views of the editorial board,\" also warned that the United States \"will suffer serious consequences\" if it continues to interfere in the South China Sea, as China calls the East Sea."}

Reflecting concerns about domestic instability, the 2013 domestic security budget will rise 8.7 percent to 769.1 billion yuan, compared with a 10.7 percent increase in defense spending to 740.6 billion yuan ($119 billion). The figures show that the ruling Communist Party is not only wary of island disputes with Japan and Southeast Asia or the US \"rebalancing\" in Asia, but also concerned about growing popular discontent over corruption, pollution and abuse of power. According to some studies, the number of unrest incidents recorded by the Chinese government rose from 8,700 in 1993 to 90,000 in 2010. The government has not released official figures for recent years. \"It shows that the party is more concerned about the risk of unrest from within than from without,\" said Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch in New York. \"A government that is confident that it is not afraid of its people does not need to spend more on internal security than on defense.\" Military ambitions This year, China's defense spending was 5.4 percent of its total budget, slightly higher than 5.3 percent last year, and only a fifth of what the United States spent. Still, many foreign experts believe that China hides the real amount it spends on its military. Many foreign experts still believe that China hides the actual amount of money spent on the military. \"For a long time, space development and new weapons have not been included in the defense budget.\" \"Although China spends a lot on defense-related space programs, it does not disclose it,\" said Toshiyuki Shikata, a professor at Japan's Teikyo University. Last year, China planned to increase defense spending by 11.2 percent, but the actual spending was 691.3 billion yuan, higher than the expected 670.3 billion. The budget figure was announced as China's National People's Congress opened in Beijing to complete the final step in a decade-long leadership transition. Outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao delivered a report from the State Council, or the Chinese government. He is expected to focus on economic issues.

In mid-October, a meeting of the Russia-Vietnam Intergovernmental Committee took place in Hanoi, discussing the progress of preparing documents to be signed when Mr. Putin visited Hanoi. Despite having a close relationship thanks to the legacy of cooperation from the former Soviet Union, Russia-Vietnam economic relations remain modest. Currently, Russia has 93 projects with a total registered capital of 2 billion USD, ranking 18th out of 101 countries and territories investing in Vietnam. Vietnam has 16 investment projects in Russia with a total capital of 1.7 billion USD. The meeting in Hanoi on October 16 set a target of increasing two-way trade turnover to $15 billion by 2020 compared to the expected $4 billion this year. Russia and Vietnam have traditionally had strong relations in the fields of oil and gas exploration, education and arms trade. The first Kilo submarine produced by Russia for Vietnam, named Hanoi, is expected to be brought to Cam Ranh port early next year. Mr. Vsevolod Vovchenko, Head of the Department for Cooperation between Asia-Pacific Countries of the Russian Ministry of Economic Development, who has just returned from Hanoi, stated: \"These documents cover many different areas: the energy and mining industry, the supply of Russian civil aircraft to Vietnam, on peaceful nuclear energy and education.\" The Russian side also revealed that there will be 12 priority investment projects in the next 10 years worth a total of $20 billion. Among them are: In the long term, the roadmap for Russia-Vietnam trade relations is taking into account the agreement on a free trade area between Vietnam and the three countries of the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Russia plans to build a hotel in Cam Ranh. It is expected that the signing of this agreement can take place in 2015.

{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content into one sentence.\nTaiwanese Dignity, Vietnamese Dignity\nTaiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen, during a campaign rally on January 5, 2020, said: 'I would like to thank all the voters who participated in today's election. Regardless of who you voted for, by participating in this election, you have brought democratic values into practice. Through each presidential election, Taiwan has shown the world how much we value freedom, democracy, and our country.' (see the speech on YouTube) These few brief words are enough to demonstrate the dignity of the people and the island nation of Taiwan. It is hard to believe that before the 1980s, Taiwan was still ruled by a 'dictatorial' regime with anti-communist policies, strict rule, and severe human rights violations. The then leader of Taiwan, the late President Chiang Ching-kuo (1910 - 1988), who was trained in the Soviet Union and deeply admired Trotsky's works, understood the art of ruling with an 'iron fist,' which he applied to govern the island's population of more than 10 million (now over 23 million). But everything changed due to pressure from mainland China, governed by the Communist Party, which has always sought to reclaim Taiwan, alongside Western encouragement, especially from the United States. Understanding that democracy is the key to survival, Chiang himself gave the green light for a dramatic transformation – lifting martial law in 1987, releasing political prisoners, banning repression, allowing opposition, and free press, paving the way for the first presidential election in 1996. Since then, in just over 20 years, along with economic prosperity, Taiwan has truly become a democratic model to be admired in Asia, on par with the West, and respected worldwide, despite only having 14 countries maintaining formal diplomatic relations. This is thanks to both the leaders and the people respecting and abiding by the rule of law – the 'rule of law' spirit. In March 2014, during the 'Sunflower Student Movement,' when tens of thousands of young people surrounded and occupied the Legislative Yuan building for over 20 days, fearing that vague provisions in the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement, which former President Ma Ying-jeou intended to sign with Beijing, would harm Taiwan, the government chose not to use force but opted for dialogue. As for the people, they organized a peaceful and orderly protest, with hardly any clashes that could have caused unwanted harm to both sides. Anyone who witnessed this would surely feel the promising future of Taiwan and admire its people. Vietnamese Dignity and the Dong Tam Incident Dong Tam: Can Vietnam turn disaster into opportunity? The cost of land in Dong Senh and the call for violence. Mr. Le Dinh Kinh, 84 years old, a former leader of the party and government in the commune, was killed during the 'raid and crackdown' on January 9, 2020, by the government and police in Hoanh village and Dong Tam commune. Vietnam: Voices for Dong Tam are still being suppressed? President Tsai Ing-wen targets the youth and the belief in democracy. However, Vietnam failed to do the same. During the 'horrific' incident in Dong Tam on January 9, instead of dialogue, the government chose to use force, leaving deep scars that are hard to heal, further pushing the 'land petitioners' into opposition against the government and tarnishing Vietnam's image in the eyes of the international community. There have been too many lessons: Tien Lang, Van Giang, yet those in power seem unwilling to learn. Even in the highly censored TV series 'Sinh Tu' (Life and Death) airing on VTV, aimed at promoting anti-corruption and cleaning up the government apparatus, the fictional character, the Party Secretary of Vietnam Thanh (played by NSND Trong Trinh), told an elderly leader of the land-losing people: 'You must trust the people. If you don't trust the people, who will you trust? And why should we fear the people?' But it seems that those in charge of the Dong Tam campaign did not watch that episode or were unable to understand the message the script intended to convey. What do young people in Taiwan say about President Tsai Ing-wen's victory? Vietnam is being squeezed by China in many areas, not only on the sea and land but also economically and even politically... Vietnam desperately needs support from the U.S. and its allies to 'escape from China.' However, if it continues to behave this way, the government loses its legitimacy and moral authority to call on others, especially 'close allies,' to adhere to international principles and laws. And perhaps only states like China, North Korea, Russia, and Vietnam would choose this path. There's no hope left, and I would like to quote a line from the song 'Loi Nguyen Cho Que Huong' (Prayer for the Homeland) by Hai Linh as a closing: 'Mother, please look down on Vietnam. The sky is dark and injustice is spreading. Please raise your hand to grant peace and safety. Lead Vietnam through this dangerous moment... Mother, please look down on the suffering people.

A large number of dead fish were found along 200 kilometers of coastline in central provinces such as Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, and Quang Tri since early April, affecting the lives of fishermen and residents there. Many suspect that wastewater from a Taiwanese steel factory, a facility of Formosa Plastic, is the culprit. Environmental groups and local people have accused the factory. One such person, Le Quang Dung, a migrant worker to Taiwan just before the mass fish deaths started, said even then the fish catch had begun to decline. At the press conference in Taipei, he described how the disaster had impacted his family and villagers and why they suspected the Formosa steel plant in Ha Tinh. 'A relative of mine is a diver. He said when he went near the factory’s discharge pipe, he couldn’t breathe and had to leave immediately.' 'The wastewater had two colors, yellow and black. Since then, we couldn’t fish anymore, many fish died, and we had no livelihood.' A Vietnamese priest who helps migrants in Taiwan said at least one person had died, and many locals were found to have heavy metals in their bodies. 'Not only did the fish die, but chickens died too. People who ate the fish got sick. When they went to the hospital, doctors wouldn't show them the test results. Many factors made us suspicious of the Formosa steel plant,' said Father Nguyen Van Hung, head of the Legal Aid Office for Workers and Vietnamese Brides in Taiwan. 'If they claim no responsibility for this disaster, they need to prove it,' Father Hung emphasized. His organization helps about 150,000 Vietnamese migrant workers with various issues. He was the one who persuaded two non-governmental organizations in Taiwan to organize the press conference, which was attended by several concerned legislators and a government representative. Many local television stations and reporters were present. Speaking to the media, Father Hung hoped the Taiwanese people would express concern. 'This could affect Taiwan. Products from Vietnam may be imported here and affect the Taiwanese people,' he said. Along with Father Hung, Chang Yu-yin, director of the environmental association, said the company needs to disclose what chemicals were used to clean the discharge pipes before the fish deaths and argued that the Taiwanese government should require Taiwanese companies to comply not only with local laws but also with Taiwan's standards and regulations. 'Formosa Plastic is the largest shareholder in the steel plant. The Ha Tinh steel plant is a Taiwanese company. Formosa Plastic needs to provide information and organize an investigation team, including independent experts, and publicly disclose the results,' said Chang. He added, 'When we invest abroad, do we just meet the standards of developing countries? Why don’t we meet international standards for human rights, labor, and the environment, or do we relax the standards?' However, Chow Ching-sway, a senior specialist at the Investment Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said that after the government evaluates and approves the overseas investment applications of Taiwanese companies, it does not address issues that arise afterward. He said it is the responsibility of the countries where Taiwanese companies operate to address legal violations there. 'Currently, we don’t have laws related to the investment of a company after the Taiwanese government has approved it. If the public wants the Taiwanese government to investigate companies, they must pass a new law.' But critics say this will only harm the newly elected government’s plan to increase investment in Southeast Asia to reduce dependency on China. Formosa has neither denied nor confirmed the allegations, only stating that there is no evidence linking the factory to the fish deaths. On Thursday, Formosa Ha Tinh Vice President Chang Fu-ning confirmed reports that the Vietnamese government had temporarily suspended the steel plant’s operation due to the need to apply for an environmental protection permit, but he believed the suspension would not last long. The plant is scheduled to begin operations at the end of June. 'We are still operating normally here, nothing is suspended. We just delayed the production inauguration a little. We need the government’s permission [from Vietnam].' 'We are filing for permission. We had planned to start steel production at the end of June, but now we need to talk to the government. The suspension may last 2-3 months, but we are sure we will start production. The plant is already completed, so why shouldn’t it operate? We need to apply for an environmental protection permit. This has nothing to do with the fish deaths,' Chang told the BBC. The Vietnamese government stated that it had completed the investigation but was awaiting expert feedback. The investigation results are expected to be announced soon. Non-governmental organizations, along with the priest and Vietnamese migrants, plan to hold a protest outside the hotel where a subsidiary of Formosa Plastic is holding a shareholder meeting to exert pressure on the company."}

The ministry asked Vietnam to immediately stop digging ditches in Pak Nhay commune, O Yadav district, where a delegation of Cambodian opposition lawmakers recently inspected and accused Vietnam of \"encroaching on land\". This area has not yet been marked with a border marker between the two sides. However, the Cambodian side's note reiterated that in the meeting between Prime Minister Hun Sen and Politburo member of the Communist Party of Vietnam Le Hong Anh on June 9 in Phnom Penh, the two sides agreed on the stance that \"unmarked areas cannot be changed until they are demarcated\". Vietnam and Cambodia signed the 1985 National Border Demarcation Treaty and the Supplementary Treaty to the 1985 National Border Demarcation Treaty signed in 2005.

Chairman of the Joint Border Committee Var Kimhong is said to have asked local authorities to stop any Vietnamese working in the area and report immediately to the committee for urgent action. Mr. Var Kimhong said that on June 24, experts would be sent to measure and asked Vietnam \"not to move the markers\". The Vietnamese Embassy has not yet responded to the diplomatic notes from the Cambodian Foreign Ministry.

These land lots are under Mr. Vu Nhom's name, and transactions have been suspended since early June 2018 according to the decision of the Da Nang People's Committee. A leader of the Son Tra District Land Registration Office at that time said he was 'confused' about whether to stop transactions for the land lots that had been transferred to secondary investors. While 'waiting for instructions', this branch of the office temporarily suspended the processing of related records. Could Vu 'Nhom' face life imprisonment? Mr. Anh Vu was prosecuted and detained for four months. What did the media say about the Phan Van Anh Vu case? This suspension was assessed by lawyers as 'arbitrary'. Lawyer Le Cao (Da Nang City Bar Association) told Tuoi Tre newspaper that the law only stipulates the freezing and prevention of civil transactions regarding assets 'derived from crimes' of suspects under investigation and trial in order to find a solution to recover them. If citizens buy and own assets legally, do not consume them or register them in the suspect's name, their transactions cannot be stopped. In the case that people legally buy assets under Mr. Vu Nhom's name through a project, when violations related to Mr. Vu occur, Mr. Vu himself and relevant authorities must be held responsible, not the people. In mid-June, the Vietnamese investigation agency proposed to prosecute Mr. Phan Van Anh Vu for abusing his position and power to appropriate assets. The highest penalty for this crime is life imprisonment. Previously, Mr. Anh Vu was prosecuted for \"intentionally disclosing state secrets\" and \"tax evasion\" in Da Nang and several other localities.

It is a vote in which everyone (or almost everyone) of voting age is eligible to vote, usually to choose between “Yes” or “No” to a question. The option that wins the majority of votes is the one chosen. Why is there a referendum? British Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to hold a referendum if he wins the 2015 general election, in response to growing calls from his Conservative Party and UKIP MPs. These MPs say Britain has had no say since 1975, when the country voted to remain in the EU in a referendum. The EU has changed a lot since then, gaining more control over people’s daily lives, the MPs argue. \"It's time for the British people to have their say,\" Mr Cameron said. \"It's time to address the European question in British politics.\" What is the European Union? The European Union (EU) is an economic and political bloc of 28 European countries. It was formed after World War II to promote economic cooperation between member states. The idea was that countries that trade together would avoid going to war with each other. Since then, the EU has developed into a \"single market\", allowing free movement of goods and people. The EU has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 member states, and its own parliament, which now makes regulations on a wide range of issues, from the environment, transport, consumer rights to even things like mobile phone chargers. What was the question in the referendum? \"Should the UK remain a member of the European Union or should it leave the European Union?\" What does 'Brexit' mean? It is an acronym for Britain's exit from the EU, similar to the word Grexit used to refer to Greece's possible exit from the EU. Who is eligible to vote? British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens aged 18 or over who are permanent residents in the UK, as well as British citizens living abroad who have been registered to vote in the UK within the last 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar are also eligible to vote, unlike in the general election. Citizens from EU countries, except Ireland, Malta and Cyprus, are not eligible to vote. How do I vote? It's the same as voting in any other election.

Has David Cameron not tried to change the terms of Britain’s EU membership? Yes. This was big news in January and February, when David Cameron tried to strike a deal with EU leaders to change the terms of Britain’s membership. He said the deal, which would take effect immediately if Britain voted to remain in the EU, would give Britain “special” status within the 28-nation bloc, and would address some of the things Britons say they dislike about the EU, such as high levels of immigration and the loss of the ability to run their own affairs. Critics say his deal makes little difference and falls far short of what he promised when he announced plans for a referendum."}

{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content into one sentence.\nMinh Bach's opinion from Ho Chi Minh City\nWhat is freedom of thought? What is censorship of thought? Is it necessary to censor thoughts? A person with freedom of thought simply means that he has the right to think, the right to express his thoughts to everyone, the right to share those thoughts without having to endure any other pressure to force him to give up those thoughts. So if someone is living under the leadership of a government and he has thoughts that are different from the thoughts of that government, with the ability to harm the leadership of that government, then does that government have the right to ban or, in other words, censor his thoughts? The problem is very simple: in a democratic society, no one will accept censorship of thoughts. Any British citizen can say: I like Marxism-Leninism, I will act according to it without fear of any repression or criticism from the government because that is his own opinion. He can like or dislike a certain ideology. No one has the right to force you to believe in something if you do not want to. Even in science, if you do not believe that the law of universal gravitation is the absolute truth, no physicist will force you to believe that it is really the truth. They only try to explain to you that the law is used to explain the attraction between objects and they find it reasonable in many cases. However, you can also find another law as long as you can prove to them that your law is correct to explain phenomena such as an apple falling to the ground without flying up into the sky, the earth revolving around the sun... Freedom of thought is the most important thing, the driving force of the development of society and science. If everyone believes that Newton's laws of mechanics are absolutely correct, how could Einstein's theory of relativity have been born when it partly broke the views of Newton, who once said: \"Physics has nothing more to learn\". As analyzed above: censorship in thought will hinder the development of society. Even if there are certain streams of thought that oppose the orthodox streams of thought of the government, it does not necessarily mean that those streams of thought are wrong and need to be suppressed. For example, the anti-war protest movement of the American people right in the United States, that was an anti-war ideology against the orthodox ideology of the government at that time. Suppose the American government tried to suppress and extinguish that ideology successfully, what would happen? The American people would live in a state of fear and tension. They would not dare to think and express their thoughts to everyone. America would gradually go to ruin. In short, freedom of thought and freedom to express one's thoughts to everyone is one of the sacred rights that a human being must have in a democratic society. If a society restricts those rights in one way or another, it is only a formal democratic society. Transparent"}

Coronavirus: When will Vietnam completely ban the consumption of wild animals? Fighting the coronavirus with goodwill. Coronavirus: Trump asserts he has 'total authority' to lift lockdowns. He accused the United Nations agency of mismanaging and covering up the virus's spread after it emerged in China, stating that the organization must be held accountable. Trump had previously accused WHO of favoring China. The U.S. president has also faced criticism in the U.S. for his handling of the pandemic. \"I am directing my administration to suspend funding while we assess the role of WHO in its mismanagement and cover-up of the virus's spread,\" Trump said in a White House briefing. \"WHO has failed in its core mission and must be held accountable,\" he added. In response to Trump's remarks, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said that now is \"not the time\" to cut funding to WHO. The United States is the largest donor to WHO, contributing $400 million last year — just under 15% of the organization's total budget. China contributed nearly $76 million in 2018-19, according to WHO's website. The organization made a call in March for donations of $675 million to help combat the pandemic and is reported to be planning new fundraising with at least $1 billion. \"With the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, we are deeply concerned whether America's generosity is being used in the best possible way,\" the president said. The U.S. is the hardest-hit country in the coronavirus pandemic with 608,377 cases and 25,981 deaths. President Trump accused WHO of not properly assessing the outbreak when it first appeared in Wuhan. \"If WHO had done its job and sent health experts to China to objectively assess the situation and point out China's lack of transparency, the pandemic could have been detected at the source with very few deaths,\" he said to reporters. \"This would have saved thousands of lives and prevented global economic damage. Instead, WHO accepted China’s superficial assurances... and defended China's actions.\" However, reporters at the White House pointed out that Trump had previously praised China's response to the outbreak and downplayed the risk of the virus in the U.S. What about the lockdown? Speaking in the Rose Garden at the White House, President Trump also said that the plan to reopen the country \"is nearing completion.\" \"I will soon be speaking to all 50 governors, and I will authorize each governor to implement a plan,\" he said. \"The federal government will monitor them closely. We will allow governors to take responsibility, but we will work with them to ensure the plan is executed well.\" Trump stirred controversy on Monday when he said that he, not the state governors, had the authority to lift the lockdown and restart the economy. Legal experts argued that state governors are responsible for managing their states under U.S. law. Earlier on Tuesday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo accused President Trump of \"challenging\" him. New York State has the highest number of virus cases, with nearly 190,000 cases and over 10,000 deaths. However, there are signs of improvement as the number of people requiring hospital treatment begins to decrease. Trump targets China's growing influence Analysis by Barbara Plett-Usher On one level, this move is related to the coronavirus. Officials have strongly accused WHO of mishandling the pandemic, saying the organization was biased towards China. They claim that WHO was too quick to support China’s early misleading statements about the virus and later failed to adequately counter Beijing’s efforts to cover up false information. Specifically, President Trump targeted WHO’s criticism of his travel restrictions on China. But on another level, the move to embarrass WHO is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to limit China's growing global influence. Their argument is that China’s leadership in international organizations has weakened an international system that operates based on rules and accountability, which is essential to prevent and counter a pandemic. However, the Wall Street Journal reported that this decision also stemmed from ongoing discussions about whether there is a connection between U.S. aid dollars and the number of Americans working in the organizations receiving them. Why is WHO facing criticism? This is not the first time WHO's response to the outbreak has been scrutinized. In February, WHO stated that widespread travel restrictions were not necessary to prevent the spread of Covid-19 — advice that was later ignored by most countries. In March, WHO was also accused of being overly influenced by China after a senior official refused to discuss Taiwan's response to the pandemic. Meanwhile, some health experts said that WHO's guidance on masks caused confusion among the public."}

{"instruction": "Please summarise the following in one sentence.\nIs it luck or talent that makes you rich so quickly?\nDo the children of the rich at least know that they didn't make it? Britain has the highest income inequality in Europe, partly because of false illusions about wealth. In countries where there are fewer rich people, they tend to have less illusions, about themselves, about others, about what is possible and about why some people get rich. In the UK, it's not surprising to read an investment banker saying that £100m is a lot of money but \"not an unreasonable amount\". In a report in The Guardian earlier this month, we also heard that one particular banker was \"quite convinced\" that a driven and passionate individual could \"start from nothing and make £100m in 20 years\". However, there is hope. In a research paper that kickstarted a new series, Katharina Hecht at the London School of Economics and Political Science found that a third of her sample of the very rich working in London agreed that “the government should reduce income inequality”. The sample was extremely small and this subset of the very rich had never been asked the same questions before, but what they said matched reports from the US last year that suggested attitudes among the very rich were starting to change. Although “not an unreasonable amount of money”, £100m could pretty much buy you a superyacht. In New York in 2016, 50 millionaires wrote to the state governor, Andrew Cuomo, asking him to raise their taxes because they believed economic inequality had grown too high. The group included Abigail Disney, granddaughter of Walt Disney, and Steven Rockefeller, a fourth-generation member of the wealthy family. The descendants of the rich at least know that they did not build their wealth, let alone create it out of thin air. In fact, no one creates wealth out of thin air, as the mythical phrase “wealth creator” suggests. Most wealth is taken from others, not made. Wealth can grow, but only if it is shared well, not held in the hands of a few. The rate of wealth growth is highest in countries that are more equitable than their neighbors. Four years after the financial crash, Michael Lewis, one of the most successful people ever to write about the financial industry, tried to explain to a group of Princeton University graduates why much of his success, and that of his audience, was due to luck. The author of The Big Short and Moneyball tells them that luck is slightly in their favor if they are born into wealth: Get lucky Wealth grows best in more equitable countries The world Lewis is talking about is not the world as a whole, but the world as conceived by the elites in unequal countries. By “the world” he means “America,” and in particular he means the “American Dream,” the idea that anyone can achieve this dream if they work hard enough and are talented enough, no matter how economically unequal they compete in. The American Dream is a myth, like the London investment banker’s fantasy. People who make money are usually not very talented at all. They are just lucky at the right time in their lives. They may have worked hard and often struggled and wanted, but thousands of others have worked just as hard, wanted just as much, and not always been lucky. Most often, those who make money have had money given to them from the start, through inheritance that increases their chances of being lucky; but it is always luck. Don’t buy into the myth of the self-made, good, kind, and gifted entrepreneur. Is wealth hard work or luck? We live in a world where those who have gotten to the top have done so not because of great merit, but because they often had a few unfair advantages to start with, such as being born male, white, and rich, because they had a lot of luck on the way up, and often because they were willing to take other people’s chances as they went up. The human world does not consist of just a few superior people who are capable of doing the key things that need to be done and a mass of inferior people who can never do those things and must therefore be punished accordingly.

The Caribbean island's presence on the list, alongside Syria, Iran and Sudan, has been a contentious issue in talks to reopen embassies. The US trade embargo on Cuba remains in place and can only be lifted by Congress. Mr Obama met with Cuban President Raul Castro at the Conference of the Americas in Panama City last week, four weeks after he announced the normalization of relations with the communist island.

CNBC quoted an Australian regional security expert as saying that \"China has so far shown no willingness to use its excellent humanitarian assistance capabilities\" to the Philippines. Rory Medcalf from the Lowy Institute in Australia said that since 2007, China has put into service the hospital ship \"Peace Ark\" and sent it to a number of countries. According to him, the hospital ship has 300 hospital beds, eight operating rooms and 107 medical staff, \"fully capable of providing relief to disaster victims\" after Typhoon Haiyan. However, the question is whether the Philippines will accept the Chinese navy's participation in post-typhoon relief work. As for the United States, the return of the 7th Fleet to the Philippines also needs to be viewed in the new security context in the region. Not everywhere, the host government or a part of public opinion welcomes the United States. The need for emergency relief for the victims of Typhoon Haiyan is very great. According to BBC Burmese in London, after Typhoon Nargis devastated the coast of Burma in 2008, the US 7th Fleet also came to provide relief but was not welcomed. That was when Burma's politics had not changed and the military government focused only on naval relations with China through contracts to buy Hainan-class submarine hunters from Beijing. But unlike Burma, Manila has had a policy of inviting the United States back after asking the US to return its base at Subic port in 1992. Currently, according to some regional newspapers, the Philippine government has launched a $1.8 billion naval modernization program. Manila also continues to promote a cooperation program with the United States that, if completed, will allow the US to rotate troops through locations in the Philippines. One of those bases is Oyster Harbor in Palawan, on the western side of the Spratly Islands, the front line of the dispute with China. The port will complement the old naval base at Subic Bay, where, according to Asia Times, 72 American warships and submarines have docked between January and June this year, up from 51 in all of 2010."}

The protesters included two communes, Thach Bang and Thach Kim, and people from neighboring areas. They held banners with the slogans \"Protesting Loc Ha police shooting and suppressing people\" and \"Is it true that they killed people because of Formosa?\" Present at the scene, activist Bach Hong Quyen told the BBC that people started gathering at 8am and had entered the Committee headquarters, but the authorities did not send anyone to receive them. Petition about Formosa 'has 70,000 signatures' Song Ngoc parishioners and advice on Formosa Nghe An: 'hundreds of people' sue Formosa Video clips circulating on social media show people declaring their request for the district chairman and police director to come and work on the alleged shooting to threaten people the night before, and asking the authorities to compensate according to regulations. Many people were upset by the shooting that threatened people on the evening of April 2. The protest was relatively peaceful until some people described by the people as \"thugs\" attacked people with sticks and bricks. The BBC learned that before that, the Chairman of the People's Committee of Ha Tinh province, Mr. Dang Quoc Khanh, called Father Guise Nguyen Cong Binh, to ask him to tell the people to leave. The priest then entrusted Father Hoang Anh Ngoi, who was present at the protest, to call on the people to return. After seeing the appearance of Father Ngoi, the local government came out to meet the people. Chairman of the People's Committee, Mr. Le Trung Phuoc, at that time pledged to the protesters: \"The government promises to handle the police officer who beat people and compensate the people according to government regulations,\" activist Bach Hong Quyen told the BBC. A member of the Provincial People's Council also promised to meet the people the next day. People gathered early in the morning but the authorities did not come out until 2:30 p.m. Gunfire at a coffee shop The protest on April 3 was the latest development in a series of protests that began last week, when people from Thach Bang went to the People's Committee of the commune and the house of the Chairman of the People's Committee of Ha Tinh province to demand compensation. But the climax came after some people were attacked by a group of security forces on the evening of April 2. It was reported that late on the evening of April 2, some activists who specialized in finding information about the Formosa environmental disaster and helping people file complaints were attacked and fought by a group claiming to be security forces while sitting at a coffee shop in Nghia Loc. Ms. Nguyen Thi Trinh, one of the people present, said that among the group of people who came to cause trouble, one person fired three shots in a threatening manner, while others in the group threw rocks, causing one person's head to bleed and a woman's arm to break. The incident angered many people, causing thousands to gather at the People's Committee of Loc Ha district the following morning. The BBC also tried to contact Mr. Khanh but was unsuccessful. Mr. Duong Tat Thang, Vice Chairman of the People's Committee of Ha Tinh province, said the BBC had to go to the committee \"to ask for permission to speak.\" Meanwhile, the Director of Ha Tinh Police, Mr. Le Van Sao, said he was \"in a meeting and could not answer.\""}

The US Secretary of State's East Asia trip comes at a time when North Korea has conducted a number of missile tests and high-level missile technology equipment. \"We both look forward to a new era of constructive development,\" he said. Mr Tillerson said Mr Trump \"highly appreciated the discussions that took place\". Contentious issues were not mentioned, such as North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, or the status of Taiwan, which China claims as its own. The meeting took place as the North Korean military tested a new high-power thruster, according to Pyongyang's state news agency. 'Having criticized' Washington wants China, North Korea's main trading partner, to use its influence to curb its weapons programs.

Germany, which holds the EU presidency, issued a statement on behalf of the EU on Tuesday condemning Vietnam's recent sentencing of human rights activists. 'Concerned' The statement came hours after Vietnam sentenced lawyer Tran Quoc Hien to five years in prison. Earlier, on May 11, the Hanoi People's Court sentenced lawyer Nguyen Van Dai to five years and lawyer Le Thi Cong Nhan to four years. On May 10, the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court sentenced three pro-democracy activists to prison for conducting propaganda against the state. Doctor Le Nguyen Sang was sentenced to five years in prison, while lawyer Nguyen Bac Truyen and journalist Huynh Nguyen Dao were sentenced to four and three years respectively. The EU statement also mentioned three cases - priests Nguyen Van Ly, Nguyen Phong and Nguyen Binh Thanh - who were sentenced to prison in Hue on March 30. \"The EU notes with great concern that many human rights defenders have been arrested and sentenced to long prison terms for 'conducting propaganda against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.'\" The EU \"reiterates its call on the Government of Vietnam to release all non-violent political activists who have only exercised their right to freedom of expression.\" The United States and European Union countries that have diplomatic and trade relations with the Vietnamese government have condemned the prison sentences against these dissidents as unnecessarily harsh.

Why can’t India have good standard hotel rooms at affordable prices?” Four years later, at 21, Ritesh is now the founder and CEO of Oyo Rooms – a network of 1,000 hotels operating in 35 cities across India – with monthly revenues of $3.5 million and around 1,000 employees. The company works with lesser-known hotels to improve facilities and train staff, rebranding them under their own names and taking a cut of the hotel’s revenue. Hoteliers benefit from more guests, thanks to the Oyo brand. Ritesh also developed an app that allows guests to book rooms, navigate to the hotel, and, once they arrive, connect to use hotel amenities, such as ordering room service. The hard road While the company is still growing rapidly, he says the early days were “extremely difficult.” “No one believed this could be a business technology of the future,” he says. But some did. A similar idea eventually evolved into Oyo Rooms, which won him a Thiel Fellowship, a program created by PayPal and early Facebook investor Peter Thiel that pays 20 teenagers a year to skip school and go into business. He used the money from the program to start his business. The company started in June 2013 with just $900 a month, working with a hotel in Gurgaon, near Delhi. “I was the manager, engineer, receptionist for the hotel, and I also delivered things to the rooms. At night, I was coding to develop the app and improve our website. But I also built a strong team because I knew I wanted to scale.” But the only way he could convince investors of his idea was to show them the low-cost hotel experience in India. “I took my first investor to the hotel we had developed and other hotels where there were a lot of problems. He was convinced and happy to invest in something that could make a difference,” Ritesh recalls. Oyo Rooms staff redecorate hotel rooms As the business has grown, attracting investors has become much easier, and the company recently raised $100 million from Japan’s Softbank. But when Ritesh started out, many people told him he was crazy. “But that’s what makes it work. When you think of crazy things, that’s when it works and it becomes much more practical.” The journey from college dropout to entrepreneur may sound like a breeze, but he says starting a business at 17 wasn’t easy. Ritesh says that seemingly ordinary things like opening a bank account or hiring employees were much harder. Plus, many people saw his age as an opportunity to exploit him. “There were people who wanted to use me to achieve their short-term goals. But I also met a lot of good people and the experience I had with them superseded everything else,” he says. Early start Ritesh Agarwal was ambitious even as a child. He grew up in Rayagada, a small town in the eastern Indian state of Orissa, and started writing computer code at the age of eight. “I used my brother’s books and for the first time I saw a lot of things happening on the computer screen because of what I was doing. It was the first time I felt the excitement of creating something from scratch and that feeling never ended.” When Ritesh was 13, he started helping people in his town design websites. He also wrote a book for engineering colleges in India when he was 17, aiming to help students choose the right course and school in India. Looking to the future Now he has his sights set on expanding his business overseas. He wants to create the world’s largest hotel chain. But he admits that this won’t be easy. He says it’s hard to find the right people when the company is growing so quickly. Today, he focuses on making improvements based on customer feedback, and he remains optimistic about expanding the company in India, where the growing number of smartphone users and internet users offers “huge potential”. For those who want to emulate his success, his advice – unsurprisingly – is to “start early”. “Start early, start fast, and if you fail, you learn from it and your chances of success in the next start-up increase,” he says.

On Monday afternoon, a welcoming ceremony for foreign guests will be hosted by King Bhumibol in the Royal Reception Hall before the host and guests watch the royal dragon boat race on the Chao Phraya River. The guests will also attend a banquet hosted by the King and Queen Sirikit on Tuesday evening. This grand celebration is a clear demonstration of the reverence that the Thai people have for their monarch. Such almost fanatical reverence is not common in Asian countries today, even though many countries still have kings. As we mark the 60th anniversary of the Thai King's reign, let's take a look at the region's royals. In Bhutan, a constitutional monarchy was promised in 2008 when King Jigme Singye Wangchuk abdicated in favor of his son, Crown Prince Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuk. The Wangchuk dynasty has ruled Bhutan since 1907. Earlier this year, a 34-point draft constitution was circulated to the people for consultation before a referendum. However, the vast majority of Bhutanese fear that the move to a new system will increase corruption. The country currently maintains a policy of self-isolation from outside influences. In Brunei, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, who ascended the throne in 1967, currently holds ultimate power. He also serves as prime minister, defense minister, and finance minister of the tiny kingdom of 400,000 people. The king has recently indicated that he may allow partial democratization, but how far this will go is unclear. While Sultan Bolkiah is considered one of the richest men in the world, Brunei is facing serious economic problems as its oil and gas resources dwindle. Almost all food must be imported. The Cambodian royal family has also experienced many years of turmoil, when the Khmer Rouge dominated the country. King Norodom Sihanouk returned to the throne in 1993. In 2004, he abdicated for health reasons, passing the throne to his son, now King Norodom Sihamoni. The new king has lived abroad since childhood and is talented in the arts. However, his role and contribution to Cambodia's transition and development have not been talked about much. In Japan, the royal family is at a crossroads as it awaits the appearance of a male heir to the throne. For the past 40 years, no baby boy has been born, despite Emperor Akihito having three children. The debate over whether a queen can hold the throne has failed to produce a result, and now all eyes are on Princess Kiko, wife of Prince Akishino, who became pregnant in February. Malaysia has a system unlike any other in the world. Nine of the 13 states in the federation are ruled by sultans and rajas. The king of the federation, known as the yang di-pertuan agong, is a ceremonial position with no real executive role. Many also question the viability of the monarchy in a rapidly developing, multi-racial, multilingual country. The current monarch has been Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin since 2001, although a new king is due to be elected this year. And the troubled kingdom of Nepal is awaiting elections, although the date is not yet clear. In April King Gyanendra agreed to hand over power to the people after 14 months of absolute rule. A caretaker government is operating amid violence as clashes between the army and Maoists continue."}

He said that Indonesia's success is a strong message to the outside world. This September, the Sultan of Brunei decided to restore the parliament after decades of inactivity. Speaking of the ASEM conference in Vietnam, Dr. Hadi Soesastro also said that for the host country of ASEM 5 this time, the successful election in Indonesia is also an encouraging message for Vietnam to reform its politics. He said that free and direct elections as well as democratization are common political trends in the whole region, not just in Europe or Asia. Increasing people's confidence Domestically, according to Dr. Hadi Soesastro, although organizing elections in a populous and large country like Indonesia is 'very expensive', the result is that 'people are more confident because their votes are valuable'. He also believes that thanks to direct elections, the political reform process is not manipulated by political parties for their own benefit. When asked about the theory that 'Asian values ​​are not the same as Western-style democracy', Dr. Hadi Soesastro smiled and said 'look at Indonesia, we have done it, we have succeeded'.

Beijing claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, where other countries in the region including Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also claim sovereignty over parts. In July 2016, the PCA ruled in favor of the Philippines, saying that Beijing's claims in the South China Sea had no legal basis.

Nasa calls them “observation aircraft” – a fleet of fighter jets similar to those in service with the US Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. But these fast-moving fighters have a completely different mission – they support the training of pilots to become astronauts, and observe Nasa’s spacecraft and experimental aircraft. Practice your skills In the video released on May 27, 2015, the pilot of an F-15D “Eagle” flies right behind a KC-135 tanker. The pilots are trained to perform aerial refueling missions for long-haul flights. The F-15 Eagles are used by Nasa to observe test flights and help train future astronauts (Image: Nasa) This requires a lot of skill; the fighter pilot has to fly behind and maintain the right position to match the fuel tank with the flexible pump hose that drops from the transport plane, which flies at a much lower speed. On the KC-135, the pump hose is designed to slope towards the tail of the plane and can adjust the pump hose to extend or shorten to suit the position between the two planes. So why does Nasa need these super-fast jets, which are only used by the air force for heavy missions? The special mission of \"Observation aircraft\" has been in the establishment of Nasa since the early days of its establishment. In the 1960s, top fighters such as the missile-shaped F-104 Starfighter were changed and adjusted to test flying at faster speeds and reaching higher altitudes. Image: Nasa Observation aircraft are often used to monitor Nasa’s spacecraft and other aircraft. Pilots act as ‘sidekicks’ to monitor the test flights of these vehicles, supplementing the team of experts at the mission control center. Observation aircraft also act as cameras to film and photograph the objects being observed. Since the 1960s, Nasa has had a fleet of T-38 Talon training aircraft (the same type used to train US Air Force pilots); T-38s once monitored the Space Shuttle as it landed. Nasa’s fleet currently includes F-15s and F/A-18s like those of the US Navy. Both are used to collect data on test flights and help train future astronauts in flight skills. Because training people to pilot spacecraft into orbit requires more than just a regular plane. The original English version of this article was published on BBC Future."}

Since a previous ceasefire agreement collapsed in September, Syria and its ally Russia have stepped up bombing of rebel-held eastern Aleppo. Now, reports say Turkish-backed rebels are advancing on Dabiq, a stronghold of the so-called Islamic State (IS). The small town holds huge symbolic value for IS and features prominently in its propaganda. Leading aid agencies have called for a 72-hour ceasefire to allow for aid deliveries. Ahead of the talks in Switzerland, officials had played down hopes of a breakthrough. On Friday, Russian news agencies quoted Kerry as saying he had no \"particular expectations\" from the talks, while an unnamed French source told AFP: \"When you look at the results of previous efforts, I am frankly more or less skeptical about what can be achieved in the next ones.\" Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has pledged to keep Aleppo \"clear\" of rebels and told a Russian newspaper that winning the city would be a \"stepping stone\" to victory elsewhere in the country. On Saturday, aid groups including Save the Children, Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council and the International Rescue Committee called for \"a ceasefire of at least 72 hours in Aleppo\". \"This will allow the sick and wounded to be evacuated and food and medicine to be delivered to the besieged areas,\" the statement said. About 275,000 people live in besieged areas, and aid agencies have been unable to reach them since the siege was re-imposed on September 4. More than 370 people, including nearly 70 children, have been killed in bombardments of eastern Aleppo, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The group said dozens of civilians, including children, had also been killed in rebel shelling of government-held western Aleppo. The war, which began as an uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, has now torn the country apart. The fighting has been going on for more than five years and has claimed the lives of an estimated 300,000 people."}

The remaining 131 students escaped through the broken wall.\" In Vietnam, there have been many cases of prisoners from compulsory drug rehabilitation camps escaping en masse recently. There is also debate about whether or not to apply the current compulsory drug rehabilitation measures and what the boundary is between this compulsory treatment and human rights violations. Several international organizations, including Human Rights Watch, have expressed concern about human rights violations in Vietnam through forms of house arrest and repression that are considered \"disguised\" for those forced to undergo drug rehabilitation.

He also said British troops would remain through 2008, he said, until the job was done. The news of a British troop withdrawal from Iraq will be welcomed by most politicians in the UK, but questions will be raised about the strategy and political motivations behind the decision. BBC political correspondent Jon Devitt recalled that the 2003 invasion of Iraq divided the ruling Labour Party, but after a heated debate it was widely supported. The majority of the opposition Conservative Party also backed it and could not criticise the government much, while Labour politicians could not escape responsibility. But Prime Minister Tony Blair knows that outside the party voters may think differently. Labour is expected to lose big in local elections in May, with the Iraq war a major factor in the party's loss of support. Mr Blair will therefore hope that the sight of returning troops and a timetable for a full withdrawal will at least assuage voter discontent. Mr Blair is also keen to give the impression that his strategy of handing power back to Iraqis is starting to pay off, but the opposition will question the timing, the coordination with Washington on this and the readiness of the Iraqis. The role of British troops The BBC's defence and security correspondent, Rob Watson, said the UK was planning to reduce its troops in Iraq, which Washington was building up. But the situation in southern Iraq, where British troops are responsible, is very different to Baghdad and other parts of the centre. There is little Shia, Sunni or al-Qaeda violence there. British commanders also say they have more confidence in the Iraqi army's ability, and that even the police alone can keep order in the south. There is a sense that continuing British patrols in cities like Basra would be provocative, doing more harm than good. But British troops are not withdrawing entirely, remaining in a supporting role for Iraqi forces and continuing to help police the border with Iran. Although British troops have suffered fewer casualties than American troops and have faced less hostility, they are still opposed by local residents. Many feel that southern Iraq is now firmly in the hands of Shiite militias rather than the democracy they promised. Any reduction in troop numbers in Iraq will be welcomed by military commanders, who have warned that the force is dangerously stretched. Soldiers are constantly being rotated between Iraq and Afghanistan with little rest in between."}

Violence has escalated in recent weeks, with Israel carrying out air strikes and small incursions into Gaza, while Palestinian militants have fired rockets into southern Israel. When the ceasefire expired, both sides said they would respond to any attack from the other, but would not attack. The BBC's Arab affairs correspondent Magdi Abdelhadi says the end of the truce comes at a sensitive time for both Israel and the Palestinians.

The ministry said many such projects were poorly managed while Hanoi had to spend more than expected, according to Nikkei Asian Review. In a report sent to Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, quoted by Vietnamese media, the ministry said projects with Chinese loans generally have less favorable lending conditions than loans from other countries. According to VnExpress, the Ministry of Planning and Investment noted that the government's orientation for the future of borrowing preferential credit from China needs to be considered and weighed. Vietnamese react to train tickets printed with Chinese characters Vietnam's economy is at risk if it relies too much on exports to China The cow tongue T-shirt case: 'Vietnam saves its anger' Loans and aid from China have an annual interest rate of 3%, higher than the interest rates of 0.4% -1.2% of Japan, 0% -2% of South Korea, and 1.75% of India. Not to mention, borrowing from China will incur a commitment fee of 0.5%, a management fee of 0.5%, while the loan term and grace period are shorter than other capital markets, 15 and 5 years respectively. Preferential credit loans are provided through the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank), according to VnExpress. Many projects under Beijing's ODA program are progressing slowly and are of poor quality, leading to increased investment to fix arising problems, according to the Ministry of Planning and Investment. Vietnam’s first metro line, built with Chinese ODA, had its first test run in August 2018. The Hanoi metro is expected to begin operating in 2019, four years behind schedule. The total investment in the project is estimated at 18 trillion dong ($770 million), more than double the original plan of 8.7 trillion dong. As Beijing pushes its Belt and Road Initiative across the region, concerns about Chinese-funded projects have grown. Many Belt and Road projects in various parts of Asia use outdated technology and equipment, Vietnamese scholars say. They have urged the Vietnamese government to be more selective about Chinese-funded projects, as some countries in the region such as Sri Lanka and Malaysia have become increasingly cautious about Chinese investment. Recently, a number of projects related to loans and cooperation with China in Vietnam have left a bad reputation and had huge consequences for the economy, such as: Ha Bac Fertilizer, Ninh Binh Fertilizer, Thai Nguyen Iron and Steel Phase 2..., according to Dan Tri. Recently, the Myanmar government had to review a number of projects borrowing from China, including the Kyauk Pyu port project in Rakhine state, according to The South China Morning Post. This is an ambitious project of China, part of the Belt and Road initiative, aiming to expand global trade connections. But Myanmar is concerned that it will become a debtor dependent on China. The Cat Linh - Ha Dong metro project using Chinese loans is 4 times behind schedule and has more than doubled its cost."}

According to him, there have been assaults, confiscations, vandalism, and destruction of journalists' equipment. 'Restraining' On September 24, commenting to the BBC from Ho Chi Minh City, Mr. Hoai Nam, a former reporter for Thanh Nien newspaper, said: \"In my opinion, to reduce recent assaults on reporters, the law on reporters on duty must be included.\" \"Those who obstruct or assault reporters must be charged with resisting people on duty.\" \"From my experience, reporters on duty should go with others and try to restrain themselves when conflicts occur.\" \"On the other hand, assaults on reporters need to be clarified and strictly handled.\" 'Incorrect attitude' On September 24, Tuoi Tre newspaper reported that Hanoi City Police requested Dong Anh District Police to report a reporter of this newspaper who was 'incorrectly treated' by police on Nhat Tan Bridge. The assault on reporter Tran Quang The of Tuoi Tre newspaper occurred on September 23 when he went to the Nhat Tan bridge area to investigate the death of a taxi driver under the bridge. \"Mr. The was about 30 meters away from the scene and taking pictures when a group of people, including officers and soldiers of the Dong Anh Police Criminal Police Team in plain clothes, rushed in to obstruct and assault him,\" Tuoi Tre reported. \"Mr. The said he was beaten until his mouth bled and he was punched in the head, causing him to feel dizzy.\" \"The area where the incident took place had no signs prohibiting filming, taking pictures or cordons to isolate the scene.\" Tuoi Tre newspaper later recorded that the captain of the Criminal Police Team of Dong Anh District Police (Hanoi) came to apologize to Tuoi Tre newspaper and Mr. The and admitted that the unit's soldiers had \"an incorrect attitude.\" On the afternoon of September 23, responding to the Vietnam News Agency, Colonel Nguyen Anh Tuan, Head of Dong Anh District Police, said that it was not the police who beat the reporter.

{"instruction": "Please summarize the following in one sentence.\nWhat technology helped find MH370?\nInmarsat compared MH370's signal to that of similar aircraft Inmarsat relied on 'pings' received from the aircraft every hour for at least five hours after it left Malaysian airspace. Initially, the pings - essentially \"I'm still alive\" messages - were used to plot two wide arcs, one north, one south, showing the plane's likely flight path. The northern leg was always suspect because it would have taken the plane over countries with sophisticated air defence systems. The chances of the plane avoiding detection were slim. Over the weekend Inmarsat reviewed all the data they had on flight MH370 and they now believe the southern arc was the true flight path. The Doppler Effect The telecoms company studied the frequency range of the pings and how they differed from pings sent from other Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 flights. This allowed engineers to simulate the tiny changes in frequency that can occur as the plane moves. This is the well-known Doppler effect, which “stretches” or “compresses” sound waves emitted by moving objects. For a moving police car, the equivalent sound effect would be a change in the pitch of a siren. The analysis was state-of-the-art and had never been used before. It helped Inmarsat engineers confirm that the southern arc was MH370’s flight path. But the analysis revealed nothing about the plane’s location. Nor did it reveal any information about the plane’s ability to change altitude, except that MH370 was still flying. Furthermore, the analysis cannot tell us anything about the speed or fuel level of the plane at the time of the ping. The only thing it can tell us is that the plane was flying in one direction rather than another. But this is a painful truth for the families of those on board MH370, as it means the plane was far from any possible landing site. The only conclusion is that it crashed into the sea. Finding the right needle in the right haystack Chris McLaughlin, a senior vice-president at Inmarsat, told BBC News that the company was \"entering completely new territory\". Analysts will continue to analyse the data but it is not certain what further conclusions they will draw. The UK's Department for Transport's Air Accidents Investigation Branch is also working with Inmarsat to study the pings and will release more details on Tuesday. But at least now the planes and ships are searching at the right bottom of the haystack, even if it is still a big sea. The search is all the more urgent because so much time has passed since the plane went missing. The priority now is to send ships to the area where the wreckage is believed to be to narrow down the possible impact. The black box will be located close to that area, even though it is several kilometers under the sea. The data recorder has a battery that will last for about 30 or 40 days and will only be pinging for a short time. When the battery runs out, the only way left is to use a remote control device to find the black box in an extremely remote area."}

Low speed The Antonov, designed and built by the Soviet Union, first flew in 1947. It is still used by many militaries and airlines around the world. According to aviation experts, the Antonov is very useful for deploying special forces because it flies at a very slow speed, maybe only 48km/h without stalling. The North Korean air force has hundreds of aircraft, but most of them are old Soviet-era aircraft, such as Mig21 fighters, or Chinese aircraft, which cannot compete with new and modern aircraft from the US, South Korea or Japan.

She has promised to form a \"strong, stable and secular\" government. \"The task of forming a government will be taken up in a big way in the next few days,\" Sonia Gandhi said in her first press conference since the Congress party's election victory. She added that it would be up to Congress members in parliament to decide who would be prime minister. Many in the Congress party believe the premiership is Sonia Gandhi's, if she wants it. But Hindu nationalists, including allies of the Congress party, say the widow of assassinated prime minister Rajiv Gandhi is unacceptable as a foreigner. The Congress party won the BJP-led coalition and Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee resigned. The BBC's Adam Mynott in Delhi says the majority of Indians, who have long been silent and suffering from lack of electricity, poor sanitation and filthy drinking water, are now speaking out. Lessons for the countryside The defeat of the Hindu nationalist BJP in the recent parliamentary elections is a lesson for politicians who do not care about the countryside. Analysts say it is no surprise that the BJP lost despite India's economic growth in recent years. The reason is that the fruits of economic reforms have not reached the countryside and rural voters have 'said goodbye' to the BJP, despite its nationalist slogans. Prime Minister resigns President Abdul Kalam has accepted the resignation of Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee amid the defeat of the ruling BJP in the general election. Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, 58, widow of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, is set to make a major political statement today. With the vote count so far, the Congress Party, the main opposition force and its allies have won 206 seats, while the Hindu nationalist BJP and its allies have won only 172 seats. Other parties have won the remaining seats. Of course, the vote count was not completed until the evening of May 13 and it was unclear how many seats each party would eventually win. Nearly 380 million people voted in the elections over three weeks. Counting is underway at 1,214 polling stations across India and for the first time, electronic voting machines are being used, which is why the results are coming in so quickly. The Congress party, led by Italian-born Sonia Gandhi, will have to seek support from smaller parties and the Communist Party of India if they are to form a new government. Is the new prime minister Italian? There are reports that if the Congress forms a government, Sonia Gandhi could become prime minister. If so, she would be the fourth in a line of Gandhians to run the giant Indian nation. An Italian native of Turin, Sonia met Rajiv Gandhi, the son of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, when they were students in the UK. They married in 1968 and Sonia moved to India to live with her husband. She then burst onto the political scene when her husband was chosen as the successor to the Gandhi dynasty that began with Nehru. She entered politics after her husband was killed in a bomb attack. She was a popular figure in the rural constituency of Amethi, which voted for her husband. Now Sonia Gandhi is an MP for Uttar Pradesh. Although she is a foreigner, she was chosen by the Congress party as its leader because of the Gandhi family's prestige. President APJ Abdul Kalam has been discussing with legal experts who will form a new government after the parliament is suspended. In principle, the party with the most seats in the lower house will form the government. The Indian stock market, which fell early on Thursday, has recovered after signs of a Congress lead."}
