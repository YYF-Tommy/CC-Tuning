The railway strike in France further increased the effect of the taxi drivers' protest. The country where the protest was most widespread was Spain. Madrid and London The major taxi companies in Spain decided to close their contacts for 24 hours starting at 06:00 on Wednesday. According to the Spanish media, there are 15 thousand licensed taxis in the capital Madrid alone. Due to the protest, passengers could not find a taxi at Barajas airport and Atocha station. A person thought to be a private taxi driver was attacked. The Uber application, which helps to contact the nearest private taxi driver, has not yet been activated in Madrid. However, it is in use in Barcelona, ​​where the protest took place. Black taxis, one of the symbols of the British capital London, were also protesting in Trafalgar Square. Black taxi drivers, who charge passengers with taximeters, complain that their business has decreased due to the application originating from the USA. “We are bound by a set of rules, but those rules do not apply to Uber,” said Glenn Chapman, a driver of one of the taxis lined up on Downing Street, where the Prime Minister’s Office is located. Black cab drivers argue that the Uber app is a kind of taximeter and are demanding strict inspections of private taxis that use it. Uber officials, however, maintain that they are complying with local regulations. London transport authorities noted that traffic was blocked around Trafalgar Square in the city center due to the protests attended by approximately 4,000 drivers. Milan and Paris In Milan, in northern Italy, the protests were limited to train stations and some squares. Taxi drivers also demonstrated in Rome and Naples. Drivers also protested in many German cities, especially Berlin and Hamburg. The city where the protests were most effective was Paris, because railway workers were on strike. Taxi drivers slowed down during commuting hours, blocking the roads leading to the French capital’s airports, while only 1 in 3 trains in the Paris region could move due to the strike. The strike was caused by the union’s objection to the transfer of the railway network to the control of the SNCF company. The company announced that the strike participation rate was 28 percent."}

Instagram today has over 1 billion monthly active users. The company's CEO Systrom said, \"We are leaving to explore our curiosity and creativity.\" On the other hand, there was already a duality within the company. Instagram was treated as a separate company rather than a division or department under Facebook. For Facebook, buying Instagram was a profitable move. What added value to Instagram was its own culture. The creators of this culture are Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger themselves. It is thought that Kevin Systro (right) and Mike Krieger resigned due to tensions with Facebook management. The Facebookization process The application created by the duo was like the opposite of Facebook in many ways. The noisy and complicated structure that caused Facebook to deflate like a balloon in people's eyes did not exist in Instagram. However, in recent years, Instagram has also gradually increased its content load and started to resemble Facebook: Its algorithm changed the order of the timeline and the number of ads has also increased. Facebook’s efforts to turn Instagram into a revenue-generating application and add new features that require users to pay have disturbed some circles, and some have emphasized that this approach contradicts the simplicity that is Instagram’s founding philosophy. Meanwhile, Systrom and Krieger were accused of brazenly stealing ideas from the Snapchat application. However, this criticism must not have bothered the duo too much, as they continued the process of transforming into Facebook. This has brought the company to a breaking point. The main name being considered to take over Instagram is now the company’s current product manager, Adam Mosseri. Judging by his CV, this profile may worry Instagram’s loyal users: Mosseri used to be responsible for Facebook’s news feed."}

According to official figures, more than a million people in the UK have tried e-cigarettes to quit smoking. Another 700,000 people said they used nicotine patches and gum, available on prescription. More than 2.5 million people have tried to quit smoking, but only one in five have been successful.

Six years ago, the rate of people who tried to quit smoking was around 1 in 7. ‘Not the result of a single magic bullet’ Since the rise in e-cigarette use in the UK, the use of nicotine patches and gum, which are used to help people quit smoking, has also decreased. In 2014 and 2015, 1.3 million people in the country were using prescription gum and patches. Public health experts stress that the most effective way to quit smoking is still through prescription medication and professional help from local Public Health Agency units. \"The reduction in smoking rates is not the result of a single magic bullet, but the impact of policies implemented over a decade,\" said Rosanna O'Connor from the agency. \"The biggest favor smokers can do for themselves is to quit smoking.

{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content in one sentence.MAGAZINE - Why does alcohol affect women more than men?\nIn Western societies, alcohol consumption used to be common mainly among men.However, epidemiologists who examine issues such as the way diseases spread, the groups they affect, the precautions that can be taken, and the frequency of occurrence, have determined that alcohol consumption among women is increasing due to the increase in alcohol marketing to women and the change in gender roles..As a whole, men are still twice as likely as women to binge drink alcohol in one sitting.However, this generalization does not apply to young people..Women born between 1991 and 2000 are drinking as much as men today, and at this rate they may even surpass them..Alcohol-related health problems are increasing Alcohol-related health problems are also spreading among women.In the United States, between 2000 and 2015, the increase in deaths due to cirrhosis in the 45-64 age group was 21 percent in men and 57 percent in women..In the 25-44 age group, the increase in deaths from the same cause was 10 percent in men and 18 percent in women..There is also a significant increase in the number of applications to hospital first aid services among adult women due to problems related to excessive alcohol consumption..Women are more affected by alcohol because the water and fat ratio in their bodies and liver enzymes are different from men..But the problem is not just that women drink more alcohol, but that the effects of alcohol on women's bodies are much different than on men's..And it's not just about body size..Studies show that women have much less of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which is produced in the liver to process alcohol..In addition, water facilitates alcohol dispersion while oil retains alcohol..Because women have more fat and less water, their body's response to alcohol is much more severe..Women become addicted more easily Women who consume excessive alcohol develop alcohol addiction and other health problems more easily than men.This phenomenon is called 'telescoping'.Although women with alcohol problems start drinking alcohol at a later age than men, they become addicted to alcohol in a shorter period of time..Liver diseases and damage to the heart and nerves occur much faster in women due to alcohol.Women drink alcohol for different reasons than men Many of these gender-related differences in the effects of alcohol have been discovered recently..For example, the first study on ADH levels was dated 1990..In fact, until the 1990s, almost all clinical studies on alcohol were conducted only on men..It was assumed that the findings obtained in these studies would also be valid for women..One of the findings of Sharon Wilsnack, a professor of psychiatry who did her doctorate at Harvard University in the 1970s on the effects of alcohol on women, was that women with alcohol problems were often sexually abused as children..Brain sensitivity Brain scans of alcoholics in the 2000s showed that women's brains were more sensitive to alcohol.But Marlene Oscar-Berman, a professor of anatomy and neurophysiology at Boston University School of Medicine, noticed something.The 'reward centre' in the brain of men who drank alcohol for a long time was smaller than in men who did not drink alcohol.This area of ​​the brain affects motivation, decision making and basic survival instincts..Until the 1990s, all clinical studies on alcohol were conducted on men..But the reward center was larger in alcoholic women than in non-alcoholic women, meaning that alcoholic women had less brain damage than alcoholic men..Berman emphasizes that this finding was very surprising, because until then there was a widespread belief that alcohol-related brain damage would be greater in women..But scientists don't yet know what causes this difference..Such findings suggest that gender-specific studies on alcohol and addiction should be given importance..Women's treatment groups Women with alcohol addiction do better in all-women treatment groups, says Dawn Sugarman, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School..Additionally, women need to be educated about their gender-specific addiction problems and the motivational factors that lead to their drinking..Research shows that these motivations are different from those of men, with men being more likely to be driven by social pressure, while women are more likely to resort to alcohol to numb emotional pain..The fact that alcohol use in women depends on different motivations, that they are biologically sensitive to alcohol, and that the trauma factor is particularly important in addiction, necessitate research on the needs of women that may be different from men in alcohol treatment..For example, alcoholic women who have been sexually abused may not feel safe seeking treatment in groups that are 70 percent male..Listening to other women's stories and seeing that they are not alone can be more effective in treating these women..But most importantly, the days of conducting research on the effects of alcohol only on men and assuming that these findings would also apply to women are long gone.."}

The article, which begins by stating that today's world is far from balanced, draws attention to three developments that are sources of tension. The first is North Korea's missile tests, the second is the tension between Russia and Turkey, and the third is the tension in Ukraine. \"The difficult stability in the bipolar world of 1945-1989 has been replaced by an extraordinarily unstable international system,\" the newspaper writes. The end of the article is 'The South China Sea and Turkey's southern border, the fault lines' After reporting that the US has taken action to support a new defense system to be established in South Korea, the Times states that North Korea, which it describes as a \"rogue dictator,\" has two consequences for its desire for nuclear weapons. According to the newspaper, one of these is that \"a dictator's unruly attempt to disrupt the world order has largely gone unchallenged.\" The second is “the risk that the United States and China will clash over the South China Sea.” The Times writes that, although there has been no military conflict between the two countries since Turkey shot down a Russian jet in November, there has been major diplomatic and trade friction. “Moscow has stepped up its support for left-leaning Kurdish fighter groups,” the newspaper writes, adding that this has Ankara worried that a Syrian Kurdistan could be established on its border. The article continues with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s statements yesterday: “President Erdoğan said yesterday that Washington must choose between him and supporting the Syrian Kurds. He indicated that there is no middle ground. “It seems that Russia is indeed on the verge of an undeclared war, not just with the Islamic State, but with Ankara itself,” the president said. “Any new incident on Syria’s northern border, planned or unplanned, could therefore push our NATO ally, the Turks, into open war with the Russians.” At the end of the article, politicians around the world are called to find new ways to reduce tensions on all these issues, with the following statements in summary: \"From the South China Sea to Turkey's southern border, these are fundamental fault lines. \"These are danger zones that demand special sensitivity from politicians on all sides.\" After the Cuban crisis in 1962, the White House and the Kremlin established a red line. \"If an accidental war is to be prevented, today's leaders must find much more sophisticated ways to reduce tensions. \"Even in times of danger when some leaders are not rational, politicians must pursue rational outcomes to minimize risk.\""}

However, Wilson, who argued that the concerns were unfounded, argued that Defense Distributed was established to be exempt from gun control laws.

area, from the Middle East to North Africa and the Caucasus..If hostilities get out of control, civilians suffer.\"The relationship between Putin and Erdogan is particularly strange.The leaders of Russia and Turkey are supporting the conflicting parties in Syria, Libya and now Nagorno-Karabakh.They also once came into direct conflict.In 2015, Türkiye shot down a Russian plane over Syria.Earlier this year, Moscow-backed Syrian forces bombed Turkish troops in Syria.Russian and Turkish leaders still maintain cautious friendship.Türkiye chooses to buy S-400 air defense systems from Russia, ignoring NATO alliance.Putin immediately declared his support for Erdogan, who was in danger of being overthrown in the 2016 coup attempt.The US was silent.\"The instinctive understanding of the two leaders is directly related to the causes of the conflict..Both are anti-US autocrats and seek to expand their influence into the power space the US has vacated in the Middle East..They are making moves on issues where the European Union is not involved.Putin and Erdogan are having a scuffle in common areas of their neighboring districts.The third key player is Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is positioned more parallel to Washington..'They are close to the use of violence' \"Their closeness to the use of violence inside and outside the country is one of the similarities of this trio.Putin invaded Crimea in 2014, intervened in Syria in 2015 and conducted a series of covert operations, including the attempted poisoning of the country's most dangerous dissident, Alexei Navalny..Prince Mohammed launched a war in Yemen, imposed an embargo on Qatar and took responsibility on behalf of the Saudi leadership for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, even though he denied personal involvement..\"Erdogan also sent troops to Syria and Libya, risking another military conflict with Greece in the Mediterranean.On the other hand, it provided military support to Azerbaijan against Armenia.He also imprisoned his opponents, journalists and human rights activists domestically..'A struggle with no winners' \"The struggle of the three leaders is, in one sense, a struggle with no winners.Libya's Turkish-backed government battles Saudi and Russian-backed rebels.Turkey's support for Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood and its closeness to Iran infuriates Saudi Arabia.\"Saudi-Russian relations are more complicated.Putin helped Prince Mohammed repair his reputation after Khashoggi's murder with his greeting at the 2018 G20 summit.But Russian and Saudi leaders clashed violently over oil prices earlier this year.\"In general, the three leaders are managing their conflicts.Russia and Türkiye are on opposing sides in Syria's civil war, but their most urgent priorities are generally aligned.Stopping the establishment of a Kurdish administration is a priority for Erdogan.For Russia, it is to prevent the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad..\"However, these delicate balances can easily be disrupted.After two weeks of fighting, the Russians brokered a ceasefire between Azerbaijan and Armenia, ending their conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.But peace is fragile and there are already reports of new clashes.Türkiye selflessly supports Azerbaijan.Russia has defense agreements with Armenia.Moscow is unlikely to tolerate Turkey's long-term influence in former Soviet territory.\"The three leaders also have a fragile balance in their external interventions and domestic power.When Putin invaded Crimea, jokes were made that Russians had to 'choose between a TV and a refrigerator'.The refrigerator was empty, but the television was full of news of military victories.Putin's popularity soars after Crimea success.But with economic difficulties and nationalist fervor waning, he faced new discontent..\"Erdogan is also facing a similar situation.Turkey's military adventures boost Erdogan's image amid economic weakness.But wars abroad can be seen as economic waste, especially when things go wrong.Prince Mohammed is in a similar dilemma.The decision to wage war in Yemen has attracted the attention of young people in Saudi Arabia, but success has not been immediate and the Saudi economy is suffering from low oil prices..\"As their economies struggle, the three leaders feel the need to project more power

Article 175 of the Constitution.The article regulates how the constitution will be amended..Accordingly, amendment of the constitution can be proposed in writing by at least one third (184) of the total number of members of the Turkish Grand National Assembly..Proposals for constitutional amendments are discussed twice in the TBMM General Assembly..The proposal can be accepted by a secret vote of three-fifths of the total number of members of the assembly (330)..The President may send the laws regarding constitutional amendments to the Turkish Grand National Assembly for further discussion..The law on constitutional amendments, which is approved by three-fifths (330) or less than two-thirds (367) of the total number of members of the Assembly, is published in the Official Gazette to be submitted to a referendum, unless it is returned to the Assembly by the President..The amendments come into force with a positive vote of more than half of the valid votes cast in the referendum..2.Will the constitutional amendment come as an 'AKP-MHP proposal'? Initially, it was stated that the proposal would be submitted to the Turkish Grand National Assembly with the signatures of AKP deputies..However, it is stated that since the MHP's views are taken into consideration in the constitutional amendment proposal and the text will be finalized by the two parties, the AKP may bring up the proposal \"We wrote the text together, let's sign it together\" in the upcoming process..It is stated that AKP may insist on this view for the \"330 guarantee\" from MHP..3.When is the referendum planned to be held? The constitutional amendment proposal is expected to be submitted to the Turkish Grand National Assembly by the end of this month.The proposal will first be discussed in the Constitutional Commission.These talks are planned to be completed in December and the constitutional amendment proposal will be discussed in the General Assembly of the Parliament in January, at the beginning of 2017..If the proposal passes the Turkish Grand National Assembly with a majority of over 330, a referendum is expected to be held at the end of April or in May..4.Will 330 votes be found for the referendum? The consensus table that emerged in the meeting between Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım and MHP Chairman Devlet Bahçeli reveals that 330 votes can be reached.The AKP has 317 seats in the Turkish Grand National Assembly, while the MHP has 39 seats..Since the Speaker of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey cannot vote, the AKP needs the votes of 14 MPs to reach 330.It is thought that this support can be provided even if there is a loss in MHP..5.How did MHP become a key party? Devlet Bahçeli paved the way for a constitutional amendment for the presidency with his statement \"Let the de facto situation become legal\".Bahçeli's comments that he is using the presidential trump card to prevent the AKP's plan to hold early elections in April or May, in an atmosphere of intense internal party conflict, are being talked about behind the scenes..Following Bahçeli's statement, news that the MHP would vote \"Yes\" in the general assembly for the proposal to go to referendum, but that it would vote \"No\" in the referendum, was first reported in the press..However, Bahçeli made the statement, \"If we say yes in the parliament, we will also say yes in the referendum.\".MHP executives are sending the message to their base that \"We are determining the content of the constitutional amendment proposal regarding the presidential system\".Indeed, MHP Group Deputy Chairman Erkan Akçay said, \"Let our entire nation rest in peace.\"Whatever MHP says will happen,\" he said..6.Will there be a loss in MHP? MHP Gaziantep Deputy Ümit Özdağ, Isparta Deputy Nuri Okutan, Balıkesir Deputy İsmail Ok and Kayseri Deputy Yusuf Halaçoğlu announced in the press conference they held that they will vote against the constitutional amendment regarding the presidential system..Özdağ, who reported that Adana Deputy Seyfettin Yılmaz also acted with them but could not attend the meeting due to his illness, said, \"We are concerned that Turkey will move towards federation and division with the presidential system..\"We are in favor of the continuation of the parliamentary regime,\" he said..Özdağ was expelled from the party by the MHP Disciplinary Board today.In this case, it seems that MHP will lose at least 5.It is stated that the loss may increase even more in the secret ballot.Özdağ, who was expelled from MHP: I will apply to the courts The party candidate Meral Akşener and her team, who are waging an internal fight against Bahçeli, are also campaigning against the presidential system.7.Will the CHP participate in the constitutional amendment vote in the General Assembly? The CHP, which is in favor of the parliamentary system, has been against the transition to the presidential system from the beginning.CHP will take to the streets in the coming days with rallies saying \"We will not let Turkey be divided\".Preparations are underway to conduct an effective \"No\" campaign in the event that there are 330 votes in the Turkish Grand National Assembly and a referendum is held..It is also stated that when the constitutional amendment proposal comes to the General Assembly, the CHP may not participate in the vote, leaving the AKP and MHP alone..It is being said that the CHP may not participate in the voting in order to prevent speculations such as \"there is support for the constitutional amendment from the CHP\"..CHP executives, who drew attention to the fact that AKP members had shown their votes and cast them \"openly\" in the previous constitutional amendment vote, stated that if they participate in the vote, they will insist that the vote be held \"secretly\" in accordance with the constitution..8.Is the HDP still at the point of \"We will not let you become the president\"? In his shortest group speech on March 17, 2015, HDP Co-Chair Selahattin Demirtaş said, \"Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, as long as the HDP exists, as long as HDP members breathe on these lands, you will not be able to become the president..Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said, \"We will not make you president, we will not make you president, we will not make you president.\".Following the arrest of Demirtaş's other co-chair Figen Yüksekdağ and eight deputies, the HDP decided not to participate in parliamentary proceedings and will ask its voters whether it will make this decision permanent..If the HDP remains in the parliament, it will become clear whether it will participate in the constitutional amendment vote, which is expected to come to the Turkish Grand National Assembly in January, according to these developments..It is said that the party is keeping the option of not participating in the vote in the General Assembly on the table.9.If the referendum results in a \"Yes\" vote, when will the presidential election be held? The president was first elected by the people on August 10, 2014.The last local elections were held on March 30, 2014, and the last general election was held on November 1, 2015..Erdogan's term expires in 2019.In this context, Türkiye will hold three elections in 2019.AKP is looking for a formula to bring forward local elections and hold them in October 2018.Deputy Prime Minister Nurettin Canikli stated in a television program that two options could come to the fore after the presidential system is accepted in the referendum..\"After the referendum, it is possible to hold elections to implement the new system, or our president can continue his duty with temporary articles until the election period,\" Canikli said..In the AKP circles, if the presidential system is accepted in the referendum, the formula of postponing its implementation and elections to 2019 is being considered..Accordingly, a legal basis will be provided for some of the powers that Erdoğan actually uses during the transition period, and the use of some powers will be postponed until after 2019..However, until 2019, Erdoğan will use the authority to \"continuously chair the Council of Ministers, decide on the appointment and dismissal of ministers, and re-establish ties with his party.\".10.Is there a possibility of early elections? CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu has made statements many times that \"early elections will be held to eliminate those who use ByLock\".There is a widespread view that if the constitutional amendment proposal is rejected by falling below 330 votes, early elections will be held..In this case, it is stated that elections may be held in April or May 2017.."}

A Boeing 777-200ER disappeared from the screens of air traffic control systems at 01:20 local time on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Many theories have been put forward so far, from hijacking to sabotage to cabin depressurization, but no evidence has yet been found to confirm any of them. Aircraft communicate with the tower through a number of systems. In this case, it appears that all of these systems have failed. Air traffic control tracks the aircraft with a secondary surveillance radar. This combines the radio waves that determine the aircraft's location with the signal sent from the aircraft's transponder (satellite receiver-transmitter). All commercial aircraft have transponders. When they receive the signal sent from the radar, they automatically send a four-digit code. This code identifies the aircraft, and radar stations determine the aircraft's speed and direction. This data is transmitted to air traffic controllers. The primary radar, based on a system developed in the 1930s, is used for support and only shows the aircraft's position. This radar cannot identify the aircraft."}

According to the report prepared by public administration professor Pieter Tops and investigative journalist Jan Tromp, the police have completely abandoned the fight against drugs. The judiciary, on the other hand, has failed to deal with the real criminal structures. According to the report in the country's popular newspaper De Telegraaf, Amsterdam, which has become the \"capital of drugs\", has almost lost the fight against organized crime. End of the news The City of Amsterdam confirmed the report that \"there is no control over drug-related crime\" in the city.

There is almost no sharing of information between the relevant authorities. There is insufficient information flow between local police and organized crime units regarding the flow of money related to drugs. The researchers have obtained piecemeal information from different institutions. No institution knows the exact size of the drug market. According to the Dutch Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), there is 6.7 billion euros of suspicious money circulating throughout the country, most of which is derived from drugs. The report, prepared at the end of the 6-month investigation requested by the Amsterdam Municipality, will be released in detail in the coming days."}

{"instruction": "Please summarize the content below in one sentence.\nEgypt's elections extended to third day\nThe Egyptian Election Commission's statement was made an hour before the end of the voting. It is thought that the statement was made after the voter turnout was lower than expected. Supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and liberals who organized the Tahrir Square protests against ousted leader Hosni Mubarak are boycotting the elections. Former Defense Minister Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who led the coup last year, is expected to win the elections. Sisi, who voted in Cairo yesterday, later told the press that \"Egyptians are writing their own history. They are shaping their future.\" BBC correspondent Kevin Connolly in Cairo says that Sisi is trying to impress the public by particularly emphasizing \"stability.\" Sisi's speeches emphasize that the Egyptian people want stable political rule after years of political turmoil. From coup to election Last year, the Egyptian army carried out a coup by overthrowing the elected government of Mohamed Morsi under Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Following the coup in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood movement was outlawed and hundreds of its members, including its leader, were imprisoned and sentenced to death. During his election campaign, Sisi said in an interview with Egyptian television that if he came to power, he would “finish off” the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Tight security measures The Egyptian military continues to maintain intense measures at polling stations. The Egyptian Ministry of Interior announced that more than 250,000 security personnel are on duty at polling stations across the country. Egyptian voters who spoke to the Associated Press news agency said that security must be ensured above all else during the election period. Experts in the region say that the intense security measures may be a message from the military and that the impression is being created that “the radical Islamist threat is always very close.” Sisi’s election promises During his election campaign, Sisi announced a series of projects in the areas of agriculture, housing, education and employment, as well as the fight against poverty. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has the support of big businessmen and a large number of political parties from the moderate left to the Islamist right. Hamdin Sabahi, who has previously run for president, is targeting young voters who might prefer a civilian candidate to a politician with a military background. Both candidates say they will not re-legalize the Muslim Brotherhood movement."}
{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content in one sentence.What is being said in the AKP circles regarding Erdoğan's changes?\n\nAlthough tensions in politics are low due to the end of the election process and the Turkish Grand National Assembly going on recess until October, expectations regarding \"rehabilitation\" efforts to be carried out in the cabinet, in line with the criticisms of the party administration and the parliamentarians regarding the presidential system, remain on the agenda..In party circles, September and even the beginning of the new legislative year of the Turkish Grand National Assembly are being pointed out for Erdoğan's \"change\" moves after the elections..\"It was expected that the trauma of June 23rd would be overcome\" President Erdoğan, after the local elections, looked for the fault in himself and gave messages of \"change\" in line with the demands of the voters; especially after June 23rd, this message was considered as a message of change in the cabinet and party management within the party..However, Erdoğan had given the message that he was not keen on immediate change by stating that he \"will not make changes upon order\"..End of the news Many party executives in the AKP describe June 23 as a \"trauma\" and make the assessment that no matter what changes are made immediately after this \"trauma\", the reactions will not be stopped and that is why Erdoğan is avoiding a rapid change..Why Erdoğan is not in a hurry for change: \"If a change had been made immediately after the June 23 trauma, no matter what was done, it would not have been seen as sufficient, it would not have pleased anyone and everyone would have continued to blame each other.\".The trauma of June 23 has been largely overcome, but it can wait a while longer and towards the autumn, change can occur, starting with the cabinet.\".Names from the parliament may be transferred to the cabinet. The expectation is high that the first revision in the AKP will be in the cabinet..The view that ministers who are not from a political background, especially those called \"technocrats\" or \"those who come from the sector\", have not been successful except for a few, has been frequently voiced recently..The biggest complaints are that these ministers do not establish a dialogue with voters, MPs or party management, cannot meet demands and that bureaucracy dominates..These complaints were also conveyed to Erdoğan during his meeting with MPs..It is stated that Erdoğan will not remain indifferent to these criticisms and this time, names may be taken from the parliament, that is, from the MPs, to the cabinet..In fact, a party source says, \"At least 5 names from the parliament can be included in the cabinet.\".In the new government system, MPs cannot become ministers and if they enter the cabinet, they must resign from their MP status..No deputy ministers were included in the first presidential cabinet due to concerns that this situation would cause the AKP to lose its majority in the special committees in the Turkish Grand National Assembly..However, party sources indicate that the balance of the commission will not change if at least 5 MPs are included in the cabinet, as 5 MPs from the opposition parties resigned due to being elected as mayor in the local elections..It is emphasized that there is no problem in the commissions at the moment due to the alliance partnership of MHP..Will Berat Albayrak remain at the helm of the economy? In the possible cabinet reshuffle, the most curious person is the Minister of Finance and Treasury Berat Albayrak, who is also President Erdoğan's son-in-law..It has long been said that Albayrak, who is criticized not only by the opposition but also by a significant segment within the party, could be moved to a different area, even if he does not remain outside the cabinet..Because his opponents were holding Albayrak responsible for the difficult period in the economy..According to comments made in party circles, Albayrak's position in the cabinet will depend to some extent on economic indicators in the upcoming period..Some AKP officials argue that the interest rate cut following the change of the Central Bank governor will lead to a decrease in inflation, that the foreign exchange has been stable for a while, and that if the situation continues like this, Albayrak may retain his place in the cabinet..It is noted that Albayrak could, in the worst case scenario, be transferred to another ministry, such as the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, where he previously served..Is Yıldırım going to Beştepe? Another claim being made behind the scenes is that Erdoğan may appoint Binali Yıldırım, the Izmir MP who lost the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality mayoral election, as vice president..According to the constitution and laws, there is no obstacle for Erdoğan to appoint more than one vice president..Erdoğan's appointment of Vice President Fuat Oktay to the Northern Cyprus coordination is also presented as support for this claim, and it is stated that Erdoğan may appoint a \"political\" assistant in addition to Oktay, and that this name could most likely be Yıldırım..Change in party management After the election, Erdoğan is expected to make changes in the organization and headquarters management, starting with the provinces where the elections were lost..However, since factors such as the loss of votes in the last local elections, the necessity to form an alliance with the MHP, and the new party initiatives of Ali Babacan and Ahmet Davutoğlu also need to be taken into account, it is indicated that Erdoğan will not want to create a new \"movement of the resentful\"..Erdoğan, who decided to gather his party's provincial chairmen after the election, is expected to go on a domestic tour afterwards..It is emphasized that Erdoğan will announce his new term strategy with messages that will convince his party base about change during his \"thank you visit\" to the provinces where he won mayoralties..Will Babacan and Davutoğlu resign? In the evaluations made in the party, it is also discussed how the movement of Ali Babacan and Ahmet Davutoğlu, which is on the way to becoming a party, will affect the AKP and other political parties..It is being commented that Davutoğlu is walking with old politicians, but the Babacan movement could attract those who are disgruntled in the AKP to his ranks..A party official emphasized that the AKP's vote was at 42-43 percent in the local elections, and that the angry voters preferred the MHP as their second choice..It is stated that the voters' reaction is not to Erdoğan, but to the party, and Erdoğan's core vote is estimated to be over 40 percent..However, it is not ruled out that the Babacan movement could receive votes from the party base..However, since there is no early election in the near future and Babacan is carrying out his work in a very closed manner and it is not even clear when he will establish a party, it is commented that there will be no transfer of deputies from the AKP to these parties, with a few exceptions..A party executive, drawing attention to the fact that Babacan's last Twitter message was dated 2015, assessed that even MPs who are resentful or dissatisfied with the party will \"keep an eye on\" the new move, which contains many unknowns..The same party executive points out that there is currently no possibility of an early election and that for this reason, MPs and party members who have discomfort within the party continue to trust Erdoğan despite the negativities experienced and that the mentality of \"he will fix it anyway\" prevails.."}

The newspaper summarizes the following information: \"According to intelligence sources, al-Qaeda groups operating in Syria have established three bases in southern Turkey.\" \"Details of the camps were revealed yesterday by the head of Israeli military intelligence, Major General Aviv Kochavi.\" \"Speaking at a security conference in Tel Aviv, Kochavi pointed to three al-Qaeda bases in southern Turkey, near the Syrian border, on a map.\" The newspaper writes that young Muslims from Europe and the US are coming to Syria to fight, and that the US and British intelligence services are also very concerned about the situation. The newspaper writes that British officials say many British citizens are buying cheap flights to Turkey to join al-Qaeda-linked groups fighting in Syria. The Independent reports: “Kochavi’s warning was echoed in Washington. America’s top intelligence officer [US director of national intelligence James Clapper] told Congress that Syria had become a safe haven for terrorists planning new attacks on the US and Europe.” ‘Britain is tracking Jihadists flying to Turkey’ “In the UK, this is also a key problem for MI5, MI6 and the police as they try to track extremists returning from Syria after months of fighting as they leave the country for Turkey via Heathrow, Gatwick and other airports.” The Independent also carries an analysis on the subject alongside the news. The analysis, published by Anthony Loyd, states that until recently, Turkey turned a blind eye to Jihadists crossing into Syria from its borders. Loyd notes that Turkey has long adopted a policy of ‘blindness completely closed’. According to Loyd, Turkey has allowed Jihadists to cross into Turkey with a \"blind eye\" policy for more than two years, while foreign Jihadists have been fed in safe houses of Islamic aid organizations. Loyd, who stated that radical foreign fighters have recently undermined the legitimacy of the revolution, and that there have been clashes between some opposition groups and groups such as ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria), says that the possibility of foreign Jihadists returning to Europe and the US has increased security concerns in the West. Loyd believes that Turkey has started to change its policy since the new year: \"Since the new year, Turkey has belatedly started to give the Jihadists no quarter, to increase surveillance and to share intelligence with its NATO friends.\" \"Incidentally, the comments made by James Clapper are intriguing. Clapper says that the main threat to the US does not come from ISIS, but from Al-Nusra, which continues to have a high reputation among the rebels.\""}

US President Donald Trump announced in May that they were withdrawing from the agreement reached in 2015 and announced new sanctions to be imposed on Iran last week.

Erdoğan is also reported to have said that Turkey wants to continue its relations with Iran and seek ways to develop bilateral relations. According to IRNA, Erdoğan said that he also wants to meet with the Iranian president face to face in the near future. Vaizi, who previously met with Foreign Minister Mevlut Çavuşoğlu, issued a statement praising President Erdoğan’s stance supporting Iran against the US, while Çavuşoğlu said that they did not find the “US sanctions against Iran right or acceptable.” What makes the protests in Iran different this time? Statements from Iran challenging the US One after another, statements challenging US sanctions are coming from the most authoritative sources in Iran. In his sermon today, the chief preacher of Friday prayers in Tehran, Ayatollah Mohammad Imam Kashani, said that no talks should be held between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the US. In his sermon broadcast on Tehran Radio, Kashani said, “What talks? Iran will not accept this. Even if there are talks, Trump will back down.” Iran’s religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also said in a meeting with a group previously described as “cultural activists living abroad” that no one should be concerned about the future of the Islamic Republic. The Fars news agency, which reported the news, did not specify the date of the visit, which it said took place some time ago, or who attended the meeting. Ayatollah Khamenei is reported to have said in his message, \"Tell everyone who is concerned about the future of the revolution. There is no need for such concerns.\" However, it is not clear whether Khamenei made these remarks in relation to the street demonstrations that have become widespread in the country recently or the international tensions created by US sanctions. Street demonstrations were revived yesterday with the rapid decline in the value of the Iranian currency, and demonstrations were reported in many provinces, including Tehran, Mashhad, Hamadan, Isfahan, Hazirun and Shiraz."}

Located about 110km southwest of Mosul, Hatra was a fortified city that withstood the Roman invasions thanks to its thick walls reinforced with towers. End of story Earlier this week, militants began bulldozing the ruins of the Assyrian city of Nimrud. It is not yet clear how extensive the damage is. The bulldozing of the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud by ISIS forces in Iraq has caused a huge backlash in the archaeological world. ISIS entered Nimrud with bulldozers It was reported yesterday that ISIS, which has taken control of parts of Iraq and Syria, began destroying Nimrud, which dates back to the 13th century BC. UNESCO’s Iraq director Axel Plathe described this development as another horrific attack on Iraq’s heritage, while Iraqi archaeologist Lamia al-Gailani said, “They are erasing our history.” Although many of the archaeological artifacts at Nimrud, located 30 kilometers southeast of Mosul, have been moved to the capital Baghdad and museums outside Iraq, there were still very important artifacts in the region. Some Nimrud artifacts, such as the Winged Bulls, were moved to the National Museum in Baghdad The attempt to destroy Nimrud is seen as an act of ‘cultural barbarity’ similar to the Taliban forces’ destruction of the Bamiyan statues in Afghanistan in 2001. Since Nimrud is spread over a wide area, it is not known whether it has been completely destroyed. But a local tribal source told Reuters: “ISIS members came to the archaeological site of Nimrud and looted valuable artefacts, then proceeded to raze the site to the ground. Statues, walls and a fortress were completely destroyed.” ‘I wish this was a nightmare’ Dr Gailani told the BBC: “Nimrud is one of the most important sites for us Iraqis and for me as an archaeologist. There were so many things that have survived to this day, reliefs, statues, the famous winged bulls. I don’t know what they are doing. They are erasing our history. I wish this was just a nightmare I could wake up from. I don’t understand why they did this.” Dr Gailani said the artefacts at Nimrud were not for worship but were part of Iraq’s identity, noting that the Assyrians were a civilisation that belonged to the world, adding: “Humans have a history. We are not animals. Animals do not know their history. We do, and that is the difference between us.” Archaeologist Nineveh Yakou, an expert on the preservation of Iraqi culture, noted that Nimrud is important for the world in many ways and said, \"Most people believe that the Dutch discovered the first lens. However, the lens was discovered 3,000 years ago and found in Nimrud. This is the kind of history that is being taken away from us. No one will ever be able to access it again. This is a global concern. And it should be addressed on a global level; it should not be an issue that only archaeologists and historians are concerned about.\" John Curtis, president of the British Institute of Iraq Studies, also stated that Nimrud is the best-preserved Assyrian city in Iraq and said that this is a terrible crime against the cultural heritage of the entire world."}

Pull & Bear and Bershka, which are affiliated with Zara's owner Inditex, have also pledged to switch to sustainable clothing by 2025. The company has 7,490 stores worldwide. In recent years, many brands have been accused of being 'fast-fashion', a fashion that changes quickly. Therefore, brands that follow this trend were launching clothing that is consumed quickly and cannot be used for a long time. End of news Starting next year, Zara stores will have containers in place to collect old clothing so that it can be reused or recycled. While calls for recycling clothing to protect the environment are increasing in the fashion world, politicians say that brands and stores should shoulder the costs of recycling clothing. The era of plastic and single-use bags is ending According to research, approximately 235 million items of clothing are sent to landfill every year in the UK. In a statement to the BBC, environmental NGO Friends of the Earth called on brands to combat the environmental problems caused by ‘fast fashion’ more effectively. The organisation’s spokesperson, Muna Suleiman, says that consumers follow ‘what’s trending in fashion’ and flock to stores each season, ‘feeling pressure to buy new products’. Zara is one of the brands that has stopped using plastic bags. Inditex announced that they will end the use of plastic bags in all of its brands by 2020, and single-use bags by 2023.

The Care Center emphasizes that these measures reduce the likelihood of being treated in intensive care if you contract the virus.

McNally especially calls on those in risk groups to start exercising, “so that if they do contract the virus, they are less likely to need intensive care,” she says. CPOC is an initiative of the Royal Society of Anaesthetists, where doctors from different specialties work together to improve the care and outcomes of patients undergoing surgery. “We have a lot of evidence that people who are prepared for an operation have better outcomes. The results are quicker,” says McNally.

a Turkish party, called on İnce, Akşener and Karamollaoğlu to support him in the event of a second round in the presidential elections..Demirtaş said that the elections were held with two right-wing alliances and that he was the only left-wing candidate..'I am campaigning with zero resources' At the beginning of the interview, Demirtaş answered our questions about how he would campaign from prison as a detained politician.End of the news HDP shared the photos of Selahattin Demirtaş taken in prison.Stating that he and thousands of party members are being held in prison as political hostages and that the European Court of Human Rights is also delaying its violation decisions regarding their files, Demirtaş said that the campaign will be undertaken by young people and women outside: \"My opportunities here are almost non-existent.\".I can only send messages to outsiders through my lawyers and mail.These are unfortunately subject to the control of the prison administration..However, my party HDP and millions of my young friends will voluntarily undertake this campaign on my behalf..\"While the current President is running a campaign using all the means of the state and the media, I am running a campaign here with zero means, relying only on the heart, courage and faith of women and young people..But despite this, I feel lucky because the power of the people will defeat tyranny..\" Demirtaş mentioned \"democracy, economy, justice, equality and peace\" when explaining which issues will come to the fore in the campaign: \"Because Turkey is currently experiencing a deep crisis in all these areas..We will explain our solution projects regarding full democracy in the state and society, production-based development and fair distribution in the economy, elimination of unemployment and poverty, establishment of justice in all state institutions, especially the judiciary, and peace policies within the country and abroad during the campaign..\"Of course, we will explain in detail what we will do to ensure that women of all faiths and ethnic identities become equal citizens..We will solve all these problems with a democratic parliamentary system and a new constitution..\" 'HDP is a strong Turkish party, we are more assertive on this issue' The strategy that HDP has been implementing, especially since the June 7, 2015 general elections, has strengthened the perception that the party is a Turkish party that is not only indexed to Kurdish politics..However, it is being commented that the resumption of conflicts following the end of the resolution process, developments in northern Syria and the waves of arrests against HDP members have caused this perception to change..Demirtaş, who did not agree with such comments, said that they are now more assertive on this issue: \"HDP is a strong Turkish party.We are more assertive today than yesterday on this issue..The conditions have revealed how important a political line the HDP is..The social polarization and tensions experienced since 2015 and the renewed conflict in the Kurdish issue have made the HDP even more important..\"The June 24 elections will take the HDP to a much higher level compared to previous elections..The surprise of this election is HDP.Everyone should follow us closely, it will be seen that this is not a hollow claim..\" 'The weapons must be silenced not only during the election period but throughout the whole period' Demirtaş had called for a ceasefire with the PKK shortly after the June 7, 2015 elections.Commenting on the clashes and possible ceasefire calls in the current process, the HDP politician said, \"The guns must be completely silenced.\" \"I advocate for the guns to be completely silenced, not only for election periods, but also for the solution of problems through democratic politics.\".Democratic politics should not only be a tactical method for a period but also a main and strategic form of struggle..Although the possibilities for this are very limited in Turkey, I do not adopt the method of violence and weapons, so I am already in democratic politics..\"But I do not find it right and do not accept that the government defines the Kurdish issue as a terror issue and tries to eliminate it by military means..The Kurdish issue can only be resolved through negotiations and democratization.\"As a party that has always made these open calls to both the PKK and the government, we are already promising Turkey an honorable and permanent peace in this regard during this election process..We are the only politicians and the only line that can solve the Kurdish issue peacefully and in the shortest time possible within the unity of Turkey..We are sincere and determined on this issue..\" 'I am the only left-wing candidate' After the election process started, AKP, MHP and BBP came together in the People's Alliance.On the other hand, CHP, İP, DP and SP decided to form an alliance for the parliamentary elections.Demirtaş, who interpreted both of these alliances as right-wing alliances, said that he was the only left-wing presidential candidate: \"We will all see how long both right-wing alliances will continue to ignore us.\".As the only left-wing candidate and alliance force, I and my party HDP will continue to defend the interests of all oppressed people under all circumstances and fight for their gains..\"It is not possible to proceed with an understanding that treats the HDP like a plague.\" In Ankara, it is being commented that one of the most important reasons why the opposition cannot nominate a joint presidential candidate is that the Good Party and Meral Akşener do not want to come together with the HDP..Commenting on Akşener and the İYİ Party, Demirtaş said that he knew Akşener and had no prejudice against her, but that it was not possible to walk the path with an understanding that ignored the HDP: \"I believe in dialogue in politics and principled collaborations for a solution..I know Ms. Akşener from the parliamentary work period, we have met..Of course I have no prejudice against him..But we have not yet heard a single sentence regarding solutions to the country's fundamental problems..\"It is not possible to walk the path or talk about solving problems with an approach that ignores the HDP and treats it as if it were plagued..We have a principled and moral stance in solving the problems of the country and society..In this context, our door is not closed to anyone..Politics is not revenge but a solution platform.Demirtaş added that this basic approach is also valid for the CHP and added: \"Our concern is to eat grapes for our oppressed rights, not to beat the vineyard owner.\".During this election period, society will be watching closely what everyone says, what they will say and their sincerity, and we will be following them very carefully..\" Selahattin Demirtaş's wife Başak Demirtaş and HDP Co-chair Pervin Buldan 'I expect İnce, Akşener and Karamollaoğlu's support in the second round' So what will be the HDP's stance if the elections go to the second round? Demirtaş is sure that he will be one of the candidates in this case: \"I hope we will have a quality election period that is beneficial for the society and reduces polarization.Of course, while the candidates are in the squares, I will be in the cell..Although this creates injustice, I expect the support of all other candidates in the second round..\"If Mr. İnce, Mr. Akşener and Mr. Karamollaoğlu support me in the second round, we can all build a democratic administration and a fair system in the country..\" 'Today we will make me the president :)' Demirtaş finally answered our question about his controversial statement \"We will not make you the president\" made in March 2015.When we asked Demirtaş whether he still stands by this promise today, he gave a humorous answer: \"Today, we will 'make me president' :)\"."}

The request stated that Netflix had described the film as \"a child who challenges family traditions by discovering her femininity\" in its promotion, but had shared the information that the audience age for the production, which was seen as a \"children's film\", was 18 and above. The expert report evaluated that \"a production in which children are involved in adult life at an early age and that includes abuse and misuse may reveal potential child abuse behavior patterns.\" The decision was unanimous As a result of the discussions, it was unanimously decided that Netflix had violated the provision of Law No. 6112, which states that \"Broadcasting services cannot contain abuse or incite violence against children, the weak and the disabled\" and that the broadcaster should therefore remove the program in question from its catalog.

Fazer Bakery announced that its \"first-of-its-kind\" bread will hit shelves on Friday. Each loaf will contain around 70 locusts, which are dried, crushed, and then mixed with wheat and other grains. In 2013, the United Nations estimated that 2 million people worldwide eat insects. According to the UN, more than 1,900 species of insects are used as food in the world. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization launched a program in 2013 to increase the production and consumption of insects worldwide. Juhani Sibakov, Fazer Bakery's innovation manager, said they had been developing the concept since last summer, but had to wait until now because they could not get the necessary approval from Finnish authorities. Finland lifted a law prohibiting the use and sale of insects as food earlier this month. In Europe, the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Denmark also allow insects to be used in food. Sibakov, who has both crushed and uncrushed locusts imported from the Netherlands, says the breads contain more protein than regular breads: \"Our product is not only a good source of protein, but also introduces our consumers to insect-based dishes.\" The loafs will first be launched in Helsinki, Finland. A student named Sara Koivisto, who tried the product, said she could not distinguish it from regular bread: \"It is just like bread.\" Fazer, which imports the locusts from the Netherlands, has limited supplies.

Amazon's market value reached $797 billion as of Monday evening's market close. Following Amazon, Microsoft's market value is $783 billion. At one point, its market value was $1 trillion. Amazon's market value reached $1 trillion in September. However, the market turmoil seen especially in technology companies later swept Amazon's market value away. So how did Amazon manage to surpass its competitors Microsoft and Apple and take first place? End of news According to American economic news site CNBC, there are 5 reasons that make Amazon attractive to investors. Jeff Bezos 1. Cloud technology Although Microsoft's cloud technology is developing faster than Amazon's, Amazon's annual revenue from cloud technology services has exceeded $23 billion. According to Synergy Research Group, Amazon controls 40 percent of the public cloud market as a company. The company's cloud technology, known as Amazon Web Services (AWS), offers more than 140 services for developers. AWS, which has expanded to countries such as Bahrain, Hong Kong, Italy and South Africa, is expected to make a $10 billion deal with the US Department of Defense. AWS has recently managed to tie large companies to itself with long-term contracts. 2. E-commerce dominance Although Amazon has focused on many different services in recent years, its main foundation is still e-commerce. Half of e-commerce sales in the US last year were made through Amazon. Amazon plans to expand its geography by expanding to other large countries such as India. It is also on the path to acquire retail companies in other countries. 3. Advertising activities, which include services such as the healthcare sector, Alexa and ads, are among Amazon's other revenue items, grew by 122 percent in the third quarter of last year. Thus, it reached $2.5 billion. Advertisers are investing more and more in Amazon every day. Healthcare is another area Amazon focuses on. Last year, the company acquired online pharmacy PillPack for $1 billion. Amazon is also investing in the banking sector. Amazon Studios is working on a number of original productions to offer Amazon-produced television productions to Prime customers. Recently, deals have been made with actors such as Nicole Kidman, Jordan Peele and producer Cheo Hodari Coker. Although Amazon does not earn a large income from its smart technology home assistant Alexa, users are seen shopping through Alexa. 4. Tight leadership team The biggest difference between Amazon and other technology companies is the leadership team that Amazon has formed more tightly than others. The company's CEO Jeff Bezos has formed a loyal leadership team at the top of the company, and these names have been working for Amazon for years. The most important feature of the core group of 20 managers is that they follow a stable course. 5. Less strife Analysts point out that Amazon has had to deal with fewer issues than other technology companies. Market analysts' analyses suggest that Amazon does not have major problems such as Apple's difficulties in the Chinese market or Facebook's privacy scandal, despite US President Donald Trump's statements targeting the company. According to analysts, Amazon is struggling with fewer risky issues than other technology companies. Amazon strike in Germany in December However, on the other hand, Amazon, one of the most valuable companies in the world, is subjecting its employees to very difficult working conditions and low wages. For this reason, strikes and protests were held in many different countries where Amazon operates at the end of last year."}

Homer's Odyssey tells of the interesting events that Odysseus encountered during his long journey from Troy to his homeland..These events may be imaginary.However, experts say that this epic sheds light on life in ancient times, and even on the flora and fauna of the region..The hero of the epic, Odysseus, travels from island to island for ten years, drawing the wrath of the gods upon himself, encountering terrible monsters and seductive mermaids, and being subjected to spells to reach his country..8 BC.This epic, written in the 17th century, has attracted the attention of many researchers to this day..The epic text has been scanned to see what meanings it contains and the striking parts have been explained..During his 10-year journey to reach his homeland, Odysseus also passes through the land of the lotus eaters..One of the things that confuse Odysseus is the north wind, which drags him to the land of the lotus eaters..Odysseus' men love a plant (lotus) that grows on this island so much that they even forget to return to their homeland..Odysseus brings them to the boat by force.There are also different theories that the thing thought to be a lotus here could be wine or opium..Some say it could be the date plum, known as the \"fruit of the gods\".The Latin name of this plant is Diospyros lotus.In his book The Quest for the Lotus, Mark Griffiths says that the fruit mentioned by Homer could be the jujube tree, whose Latin name is Ziziphus lotus, and that this plant has psychoactive properties that cause temporary changes in perception and mood..However, some herbalists also believe that the plant mentioned in the epic could be a water lily growing on the banks of the Nile River..This plant has an important place in ancient Egyptian art..Especially the blue water lily is known for its narcotic properties..There are those who believe that the fruit that Odysseus and his men loved so much and that caused them to forget to return to their homeland was the palm plum..While trying to procure supplies on another island, Odysseus and his men encounter a man-eating cyclops.Our hero kills many men before he can stab the monster in the eye and blind it..One-eyedness is a rare phenomenon in vertebrates..It occurs when the eyes do not develop properly in the embryonic state, and very few of those born this way survive..Stanford University historian Adrienne Mayor attributes the presence of such a creature in the epic to Greek farmers probably encountering numerous mammoth fossils and mistaking the large nasal cavity in their skulls for an eye socket..Cyclops is depicted as a man-eating monster.The herbs of the sorceress Circe Odysseus and his men are then dragged to the island of the sorceress named Circe and are captured by magic and

The operation comes after tensions between the civilian government and the military and rumors of a military coup. The armed forces' television channel announced that power had been transferred to Min Aung Hlaing, who is in charge of the military, and that a one-year state of emergency had been declared. The Myanmar military said in a statement that Suu Kyi and other political leaders had been detained in response to \"election fraud.\" Myanmar's Army Chief of Staff Min Aung Hlaing's NLD had secured a majority in parliament to form a government in November, but the military had called for the government to postpone convening parliament, arguing that the elections were fraudulent. End of article The Myanmar parliament was expected to open today amid debate over “election fraud”. NLD spokesman Nyunt said, “I call on our people not to react hastily and to act in accordance with the law,” adding that he also expected to be detained. BBC Southeast Asia Correspondent Jonathan Head reported that soldiers were stationed on the streets in the capital, Naypyitaw, and Yangon. It was reported that internet and phone lines were cut across the capital, and state television was suspended. On Saturday, Myanmar military forces pledged to “uphold the constitution” amid rumours of a military coup. US: Myanmar military must reverse its actions US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has called on the Myanmar military to release the detained politicians. “We call for the release of all government officials and for the will of the Myanmar people, as revealed in the democratic elections on November 8, to be respected. The military must urgently reverse its actions,” Blinken said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement that the US was closely monitoring the situation regarding the military takeover of power in Myanmar. United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also condemned the military intervention in Myanmar and the detention of political leaders. The Indian Foreign Ministry stated that it was following the developments in Myanmar with great concern and noted that it supported a democratic transition of power. The Australian Foreign Ministry also called on the Myanmar military to “respect the law” and stated that disputes should be resolved on legal grounds. Who is Aung San Suu Kyi? The daughter of General Aung San, who led Myanmar’s struggle for independence, Aung San Suu Kyi lost her father in an assassination when she was only 2 years old. Suu Kyi was known as a “human rights activist” who criticized the authoritarian rule of the military forces that ruled Myanmar for decades. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize while under house arrest in 1991. She was detained for nearly 15 years between 1989 and 2010. In November 2015, she won Myanmar’s first free election in 25 years with the NLD, which she led. Posters of Aung San Suu Kyi are on the streets of Yangon. However, the Myanmar constitution prevented Suu Kyi from becoming president because her children were citizens of other countries. Today, Suu Kyi, who is 75 years old, is the de facto leader of the country. The allegations of genocide against Muslims living in Rakhine State in Myanmar have become one of the most difficult topics for Suu Kyi and her administration in the international arena. Although it is known that she has no power over the Myanmar army, the operations carried out against Muslims also negatively affect the prestige of Suu Kyi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. The United Nations (UN) describes Suu Kyi as an “accomplice.” Following an attack on a police station in Myanmar in 2017, the army carried out operations in areas where Muslims predominantly live. In 2018, human rights organization Amnesty International announced that it had withdrawn the Ambassador of Conscience Award it had given to Aung San Suu Kyi. Aung San Suu Kyi salutes a convoy of vehicles belonging to the ruling NLD party. Amnesty International stated that the Myanmar Army was \"clearly oppressing\" the Rohingya Muslims and that Suu Kyi had \"betrayed\" the values ​​she had previously defended by remaining silent about the events in her country. Suu Kyi, however, said in an interview with the BBC that there was no ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya Muslims. In 2009, the organization awarded Suu Kyi, who was under house arrest at the time, the Ambassador of Conscience Award, citing her struggle for peace and democracy in her country."}

It is currently in ninth place. The team was travelling to Colombia to play the first leg of the final of the Copa Sudamericana, the second most important club tournament in South America. Chapecoense advanced to the Copa Sudamericana final after a 0-0 draw at home to Argentine team San Lorenzo on November 23, 2016. Chapecoense's opponent in the final was Colombia's Atletico Nacional. Last week, they had also eliminated Argentine team San Lorenzo 1-1 to advance to the final. No other Brazilian team has made it to the cup final in the last three years. The Guardian newspaper wrote of Chapecoense that \"this year has been a fairytale season\". This was also Chapecoense’s first final in a continental tournament. The winner of this final will compete in the Copa Libertadores, the continent’s most important inter-club tournament. Chapecoense was not given much of a chance against Atletico Nacional, who won the Cope Libertadores last year and are seen as the favorites this year. However, Guardian football writer Jack Lang says that the team’s morale was high before the match, that they played with great determination and that they were not afraid of the final match. The fact that their team reached the Copa Sudamericana final caused great joy among Chapecoense fans on November 23, 2016. The second leg of the final was to be played in Curitiba, 400 kilometers away, because the stadium in Chapeco, where the team is from, was not enough to host the final match. Chapecoense is the 21st-largest team in Brazil, with revenues of 46 million reais ($13.5 million). \"It's not flashy, it's not traditional...

Weren't there any schools in your country?\".Hearing about businessmen being turned away from the airport in Moscow was also a source of concern for us..'Are you Turkish? When will you return home?' We had student friends who were stopped at an underpass, asked for their ID, and had their photos taken by the police when they saw that their passport said Turkish..Among the students studying in the teaching department and going to public schools for internships, there were those who said that they had to quit their internship training because they encountered negative reactions from their parents and experienced humiliating situations such as not being able to go from one floor to another in the school without another teacher..While asking about literary theory books by Yuriy Tinyanov and Boris Eichenbaum in an old bookstore, hearing the question \"Are you Turkish? When will you return to your country?\" is disturbing, even if the question does not contain an accusation or accusation..During this process, each student researched the conditions for transferring to an equivalent university in Turkey..Wrote emails to various universities.We have become more relaxed in recent days due to statements such as \"What is necessary will be done to prevent students from experiencing any problems\" made by official sources..Still, the fear of being negatively affected by social pressures or new troubles that may reoccur in the future is a question mark in the minds of all students..Those who want to return Another sociological reality needs to be mentioned; some of the students here are those who came to Russia to study at a paid university because they could not get into a university in Turkey, and these days most of them have the hope of \"I wish they would transfer us to a university in Turkey\".Even though it was a joke, I heard many students complaining that they did not have the necessary conditions to transfer to Turkish universities..Despite the statements that can be considered as softening and reassuring for students between the two countries, there is a point of concern: Many students have come to this country under the influence of the good relations that have developed in recent years and with the hope of working in jobs that can arise from these good relations..Although the current crisis does not mean 'deportation' for students, it may mean that some advantages in finding a job will be shelved for a long time..My goals for myself were to study abroad and see a different academic discipline, learn a foreign language, get to know different cultures, gain new perspectives, and have a personal adventure as someone who grew up in an Anatolian family..I can also say that I am here because the financial possibilities are more suitable compared to countries such as England, Europe and the USA..I wouldn't regret going back because I think I've had this experience..Despite the crisis, I may consider staying because I do not believe there is a direct threat to our lives or our presence in this country..Russian is one of the common languages ​​covering a very wide geography, I think that even if its advantage decreases in this sense, it will not become unimportant.."}

he will announce his illness to his family, friends, workplace, it will be even more difficult for him to accept the new diagnosis..Your own belief and your doctor's diagnosis have led you to believe in this disease..You are receiving treatment that you do not need for a disease that you do not have, and you are not being directed to the behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, and physiotherapy that you really need..\" Overlooking the psychological source of psychosomatic disease symptoms can prolong treatment time.Having had the chance to encounter a case like Yvonne at the beginning of his career, O’Sullivan believes it is important to focus on psychosomatic illnesses at the earliest stages of medical training..He states that patients also feel more comfortable with such a diagnosis and become less afraid of being stigmatized and less ashamed.."}

Limiting fossil fuels such as oil, carbon, natural gas, and focusing on renewable and clean energy sources.In addition, it is necessary to ensure efficient use of energy and reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 45 percent in the next decade..One of the most effective individual actions in the fight against climate change is to stop using cars..Here are some things we can do as individuals: reduce the number of cars and planes we drive, turn to 'green' energy producers, and pay attention to what we eat and buy..The problem of climate change, while important in its own right and capable of influencing others, will certainly not be solved by small changes made by a small number of people..Larger-scale systemic changes are also needed, especially in the energy and food sectors, which use fossil fuels such as oil extensively..In addition, new incentives should be given to agriculture, forest protection and waste and waste management..Since HFCs used in refrigerators and air conditioners heat the atmosphere much more than CO2, it is necessary to prioritize measures to reduce their emissions..Two years ago, 170 countries signed an agreement targeting the reduction of these gases by 2019..2.Are the ways in which different sectors are operated and subsidized something we can influence? Individuals, as citizens and consumers, can push their governments and companies to make the necessary changes..Universities, faith groups and other campaigns may want to avoid fossil fuel-related investments and stocks, or banks that invest in high-emission sectors.3.Apart from these, what other changes can we make in our daily lives? In this regard, the most effective method is to limit car use.Driving causes much more pollution than walking, cycling or taking public transport..In industrialized countries, CO2 emissions per capita are around 9.2 tons per year..Giving up car use means reducing it by a quarter.Switching to electric vehicles is seen as an important step in this regard..4.Aren't renewable energy too expensive? The cost of wind and solar energy is decreasing worldwide.Solar, geothermal, bioenergy, hydropower and wind energy could be as cost-effective as fossil fuels, or even cheaper, by 2020, according to the latest report from the International Renewable Energy Agency..The cost of solar energy as a residential energy source has decreased by 73 percent since 2010, making it the cheapest source of electricity in Latin America, Asia and Africa..In the UK, wind and solar energy are expected to be the cheapest sources of electricity by 2025.If we were to consider the world's cattle herds as a country, it would be third in greenhouse gas emissions after China and the US..5.How can changing your diet be effective? The food industry, especially meat and dairy products, is the biggest factor affecting climate change, along with fossil fuels..If we were to consider the world's cattle herds as a country, it would be third in greenhouse gas emissions after China and the US..Meat production causes global warming in three different ways.- Methane gas, which is released by cattle during the digestion of grass, is one of the greenhouse gases..- Products such as corn and soy, which can be used to feed humans, are used to feed cattle..- Raising cattle means consuming large amounts of water, using greenhouse gas-emitting fertilizers, and using large areas of land for grazing..Some of these lands are obtained by destroying forests.You don't have to be vegetarian or vegan to make a difference in this regard..Even halving meat consumption can reduce carbon footprint by 40 percent.To increase its impact, businesses can limit their use of wholesale meat..During a typical transatlantic flight, 1.6 tons of CO2 are released into the air.6.How harmful is flying to the environment? Airplanes use fossil fuels and no alternative energy source has yet been found.Although experiments have been conducted on the use of solar energy and have been successful, it seems that it will be decades before it is used in commercial passenger aircraft..During a typical transatlantic flight, 1.6 tons of CO2 are released into the air.This is equivalent to the annual amount per person in India.There is also an inequality here..Although the number of people flying on planes is a small fraction of the total human population, everyone is affected by the consequences of climate change..Some scientists are using remote teleconferencing instead of flying to the meeting place to take action on this issue..In addition, taking the train instead of the plane and going on holiday to nearby places instead of distant countries also reduces the number of flights..Textiles account for 3 percent of global manufacturing-related CO2 emissions.7.Should we change our shopping style? Everything we buy has a carbon footprint, either through the production method or the transportation of the product.For example, textiles account for 3 percent of global production-related CO2 emissions.The rapid change in fashion reduces the usage and durability of clothes, which also contributes to this high rate..Importing products from distant countries via international air, sea and land transportation also increases the carbon footprint..In addition, some producers produce products out of season in energy-intensive greenhouses, creating an extra burden..For this reason, it is necessary to consume products grown in our own region and seasonal products..8.Does having children affect climate change? Some studies suggest that having fewer children is the best way to reduce our contribution to climate change, but this conclusion is controversial.Because here, philosophical questions come into play, such as whether parents are responsible for children's carbon emissions or whether having children is a human right..The average person's annual CO2 emissions are around 5 tons.The USA and South Korea have the highest averages at 16.5 and 11.5 tons..In developing countries such as Pakistan and the Philippines, this average drops to 1 ton..Even within the same country, CO2 emissions vary depending on wealth, and the amount increases as the country becomes richer..9.How much does what I do alone affect the total? Research shows that the sensitivity that develops in a person regarding the environment is reflected in others..For example, if there are people in a neighborhood who use solar energy, others are doing the same, or if a cafe where people are suggested to eat less meat now sees the amount of meat in orders decrease..Because, according to social scientists, we observe what people around us do and adjust our beliefs and actions accordingly..If our neighbors take steps in energy saving, environmental protection, recycling, etc., we are more likely to do so as well..10.What if I have to take a plane or drive?..? If it is not possible to make all the changes that need to be made, you can contribute to reliable green projects that will compensate for your carbon emissions.You can find a list of these projects at the United Nations Climate Convention.You can calculate how much emissions you need to buy by measuring your carbon footprint.Whether you're a coffee producer in Colombia or a homeowner in California, climate change will affect everyone's life.But the reverse is also true: what we do today will impact the future of the planet – for better or worse."}

Boyce said that some federations punish such behavior and that this is what should be done. Boyce said that such behaviors have become the cancer of football and that if it is determined that \"faking\" was done, it should definitely be punished very severely. Stoke Club President Tony Pulis called on the English Football Association in September to give three-match bans to players who faked. Pulis similarly stated that Liverpool striker Suarez should be sent off after Sunday's match. FIFA Vice President Boyce called for the punishment to be applied after the match if it is not determined during the game that the player threw himself. Boyce, who said that the disciplinary boards of the federations could look into these issues, indicated that he supported federations that displayed such an attitude. Boyce said the following regarding what happened during the match: \"Sometimes it is not possible for referees to perceive the position immediately; they cannot decide whether a move is a foul or something else; the players' faking makes the referees' job even more difficult.\" A spokesperson for the English Football Association said, \"As a federation, we do not take a position on the deceptive behavior of footballers, but this issue is frequently discussed and reveals the views of the relevant parties in the world of football.\" Liverpool coach Brendan Rodgers made the following reference regarding the statements of the FIFA Vice President: \"As far as I can see, different rules apply to Luis Suarez and all other players.\" Rodgers said, \"Players throwing themselves to the ground and their acts of deception are an important topic of discussion in terms of football; we would all probably want such things to be completely eliminated from the pitches, but it should also be said that positions like this were not seen as relevant at the weekend.\" Related Topics"}

More than half of the patients stated that they did not feel depressed after taking this substance and changes were observed in their brain functions. The positive effects of psilocybin on people with depression lasted for about 5 weeks. However, the team conducting the study warned that people with depression should not try this method on their own. Previous studies have shown that psilocybin can help people break out of the cycle of depressive symptoms by \"oiling the mind\". The research team imaged the brains of the patients with fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) technique before and after psilocybin was administered. The results of the study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, revealed that psilocybin affected two main regions of the brain. Its structure resembles the \"happiness hormone\" serotonin. The substance makes the amygdala region, which plays a major role in processing emotions such as fear and anxiety, less active. As the functions in this region decrease, depression symptoms also decrease. In addition, psilocybin makes the network (default-mode network), which is especially active when the brain is not working on a certain subject and consists of the communication of different regions, more stable. The structure of psilocybin is also very similar to serotonin, known as the \"happiness hormone\", which has very important effects on brain functions. Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris, the leader of the research team, said that the depressed brain \"mutes\" thanks to psilocybin and that the psychedelic experience \"reset\" the brain. Dr. Harris stated that patients also felt that their brains were \"cleansed and rebooted\" after the treatment. However, the net effect of this substance on brain activity has not yet been fully proven. It is noted that the research was conducted on a very small group and that brain images of healthy people were not examined and compared with those of the patients. What scientists agree on is that there is a serious need for new methods to treat depression."}

The Istanbul 14th High Criminal Court reviewed the files in its possession after Law No. 6526 came into effect, addressed the situation of the defendants whose detentions exceeded 5 years, and ruled for the release of Erhan Tuncel and 13 other people from other cases. Around 150 Releases Making a statement on the subject, Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said that according to the figures they have, an estimated 150 people will benefit from the new legal regulation. Bozdağ said that \"due to some cases, there is a perception in Turkey that detention is a rule and free trial is an exception\" and that they have reduced the upper limit of detention from 10 years to 5 years in order to eliminate this. With the abolition of the Specially Authorized Courts, the reduction of the detention period to 5 years in \"terror crimes\" will allow the release of defendants who are still under arrest and whose sentences have not been finalized in long-standing cases such as the Ergenekon and Zirve cases. The number of defendants in the Ergenekon case currently falling within the scope of the law exceeds 30. These are defendants who were arrested between 2008 and January 2009. Among those expected to be released are journalist Tuncay Özkan, retired Brigadier General Veli Küçük, Kemal Kerinçsiz, Turkish Orthodox Patriarchate spokesperson Sevgi Erenerol, retired General Hurşit Tolon, retired Brigadier General Levent Ersöz, Doğu Perinçek, and former head of the Security Special Operations Department İbrahim Şahin. There are 5 defendants who have been under arrest in this case for 7 years. The defendants in the Balyoz case are in the category of convicts since their sentences were also approved by the Court of Cassation and the new law will not apply to them. The status of the KCK trials In the \"KCK\" trials, where thousands of defendants are still on trial, it is not expected that many will be released at this stage. The lawyers of the defendants who are following the KCK trials remind us that a significant number of the defendants currently on trial were arrested in operations carried out in April 2009, and many more at later dates. In this case, it is understood that the release of many more defendants in the KCK trials under the new law can be expected from April-May, for those who have completed five years in prison."}

promises to them in the past,\" the report begins, adding that these groups are expecting a detailed explanation from Ankara on how to remove ISIS from the Syrian border and create a safe zone..The opposition commander Munthir Salla, who spoke to the newspaper, said that Turkish officials held a meeting with Syrian opposition commanders in Ankara yesterday..\"The safe zone statements surprised us, we had never heard of such a thing before,\" Salla says.The report continues: \"The US and Türkiye are still working on the details of the new cooperation.The deal represents a middle ground that would not require the United States to make a formal commitment to protect specific areas in Syria, but would allow for the establishment of protected areas as Turkey seeks..The report said that although Türkiye struck ISIS targets on Friday, it was \"unclear how committed it will be to fighting the jihadists\".According to the newspaper, most Syrian opposition members believe that Turkey's air operations are aimed at hindering the Kurds rather than ISIS..The report also quoted an unnamed European diplomat as saying: \"After three years of making concessions and ignoring the situation at the border, I do not believe that this [Turkey's attacks] will end the situation.\".\"They may be carrying out this attack just to intimidate ISIS a little, to gain support domestically and to hit the Kurds for President Erdoğan's political advantage.\".The report ends with the words of a Syrian opposition commander: \"We do not expect much from the Turks...Now they have turned into lying shepherds.\" CLICK: Financial Times: Turkey is heading towards a real war \"Kurds are made to be betrayed\" Independent newspaper's experienced Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk's article evaluating Turkey's air operation is titled \"All the powers in the region have betrayed the Kurds, so Ankara's bombardment is no surprise\".The article begins with the statement that 'Kurds were created to be betrayed',.It refers to the process of shaping the Middle East after World War II..Fisk recalls that at the time, almost all of the small states in the region were promised independence and notes that 'the tragedy of the Kurds has continued since the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923.'.The article continues: \"When they rose up against Saddam Hussein in Iraq in the early 1970s, the Americans and the Shah's government in Iran supported them.Then US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger built a deal between Iran and Iraq and left the Kurds alone.US cuts off arms aid and Saddam massacres 182,000 Kurds.\"Writing that 'it might be expected that the Kurds have learned a lesson from this', Fisk states that this is not the case and that the Kurds have been subjected to similar betrayals again..1.Giving examples from the Gulf War and the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, Fisk continues: \"When Iraqi Kurds fought against ISIS last year, Turkey wanted Kurdistan to become the vanguard of the West's war from afar..Kurdish defense in Kobani makes Turkey's humiliation even more painful.Pro-PKK fighters are seen as heroes in Syria and Iraq.This could not be allowed.\"That's why Turkey, after the ISIS attack in Suruç and the subsequent killing of two Turkish police officers by the PKK, \"started attacking the PKK under the guise of bombing ISIS,\" Fisk said..Fisk, who wrote that Turkey's latest air operation had put Pakistan on the path of \"complete degeneration\", continued with the following lines: \"In the 1980s, Pakistan became a channel through which weapons and guerrillas were transferred to Afghanistan, with the encouragement of the US..Pakistanis supported the Mujahideen, the Taliban and other Islamist groups.\".Sharp fall in Shanghai stock market

EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said President Viktor Yanukovych had \"primary responsibility\" for initiating talks between the two sides. Speaking after an extraordinary meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, Ashton said the ministers had expressed \"disappointment\" in the latest violence and agreed to \"suspend export licences for equipment used in domestic repression\". She added that the implementation of the measures would be \"taken forward in light of developments in Ukraine\". Sniper claim Witnesses in Kiev told the BBC that some of the victims were killed by single shots, suggesting that snipers may have been involved in the clashes. Local TV channels broadcast images of bodies lying on the ground in the square. There are reports that some public buildings in the capital Kiev have been evacuated amid concerns that protesters may attempt to occupy them. Ukraine’s Interior Minister confirmed that police officers were armed and 67 police officers were taken hostage by demonstrators. Governor: Protesters must be destroyed The Kharkiv regional governor claimed that there were no peaceful demonstrators left in Independence Square and said that the protesters must be “exterminated.” Authorities in Kiev warned people not to take to the streets unless necessary.

The officials, who spoke to the Associated Press news agency, said that although there was no direct link, Russia “created the conditions that led to the crash of Flight MH17.” The senior intelligence official, who asked not to be identified, said that the evidence gathered “showed that the separatists fired a surface-to-air SA-11 missile at the Malaysian airliner” but that “it is not yet clear who pulled the trigger and why.” The official said: “The most plausible explanation is that it was done by mistake.”"}

As a result of the government's centralization of the education system, the freedoms previously enjoyed by the teaching staff at local administrations and school levels were eliminated one by one. It was claimed that the affiliation of schools that previously operated autonomously in certain areas under local administrations to the national Ministry of National Education, the termination of the autonomy of schools and the central determination of their course programs caused serious disruptions in the education system.

Scientists believe that the size and rounded shape of the pebbles in these rocks indicate that they were transported by water erosion. Researchers believe that the robot has found an ancient flow network. It is thought that the Martian rocks, which were introduced to the press at NASA's laboratory in California, reached their current locations about seven billion years ago. However, it is believed that water currents continued to exist on the surface of Mars after the rocks were transported. Bill Dietrich from the University of California at Berkeley and a member of the \"Curiosity\" team said, \"We estimate that the currents continued for hundreds of thousands of years.\" Satellites sent to Mars had previously shown the existence of channels opened by a liquid on the planet's surface. The liquid that opened these channels was believed to be water. The evidence photos sent by Curiosity to Earth confirmed what the satellites showed. By chance, the spacecraft passed close to a sample of gravel. The 10-15 cm thick rock had settled into the ground, with some of it floating in the air. \"We named it Hottah,\" said John Grotzinger, one of the scientists working on the project. Hottah is the name of a lake in northwestern Canada. The team chooses geographic names from this region to name formations on Mars. \"The rock looked like street work in Los Angeles. It's like someone came and took a hammer and removed the surface of Mars,\" Grotzinger said. Scientists are studying gravel in the rock. The size and shape of these gravel will tell scientists how fast and dense the water used to flow. The rover is located between the northern lip of the crater where Curiosity landed and the massive mountain in its center. Previous images from the area had shown that the area was likely underwater in the past. Curiosity's photos of the gravel confirm this thesis. He now thinks the robot is amid silt carried into the crater by currents. Scientists believe they can identify the main valley where the water enters the crater, and they call this valley \"Peace Vallis\". The researchers are eager to examine the chemical structure of the gravel found, as this examination will reveal the pH value of the water found on Mars in the past. This will make it easier to predict what natural life on Mars was like in the past. The robot is currently heading to a region called Glenelg. Scientists believe that they will be more likely to find rocks that interest them in this region. The US Space Agency has spent a total of $2.6 billion on Curiosity, which reached the red planet on August 6. Curiosity has enough funds to conduct research for one Martian year. One Martian year is equal to two Earth years. During this time, Curiosity will try to understand whether Gale Crater on Mars hosted microbial life in the past. Related Topics"}

Representatives of the coalition are holding meetings in London and Paris. 'Defensive weapons' French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said they were cautious about bringing more weapons into Syria, but there was also the danger of exposing opposition-held areas to an attack by the Syrian army. Speaking to RTL radio, Fabius said, \"There is currently an embargo, so there is no supply of weapons from Europe. This issue will undoubtedly be brought up regarding defensive weapons.\" The National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces is calling on European countries to recognize the coalition as the country’s interim government, which will allow them to purchase weapons that will help them overthrow President Assad. “This issue will be raised because the coalition wants us to do it,” the French Foreign Minister said. Fabius stressed that they could only do this in coordination with European countries. Fabius said France was continuing talks with Russia and UN Special Representative Lakhdar Brahimi to find a solution. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich told the Russian news agency Interfax that providing foreign military aid to the Syrian opposition would be “a violation of international law.” BBC Paris correspondent Christian Fraser reports that the West has been reluctant to support armed struggle in the conflict in Syria, but this week the mood in France and the UK has changed.

While the US and the UK have also signaled support for the opposition coalition in Syria, this support has not gone as far as recognizing the coalition as a \"government in exile.\" Meanwhile, Israel, which is focused on the escalating conflict in the Gaza Strip, stated that the shell fired from Syria near an Israeli outpost in the occupied Golan Heights was \"Syria's own internal problem.\" Israel had previously responded to two mortar shells that fell on its territory from Syria.

Reuters, which stated that it had verified the number of Russian soldiers killed in the news with local authorities, family members and friends of the dead soldiers, stated that 21 of the 40 soldiers were brought to Syria through private companies. The news report states that 21 Russian soldiers lost their lives in April alone. Reuters reported through multiple sources that someone nicknamed Vagner commanded the sending of Russian mercenaries to Syria. The news report also included the claim that a Russian mercenary whose death in Syria was confirmed by his relatives was sent to this country with the promise of a monthly salary of $6,000. Information available on Russia's military operations in Syria is quite limited. However, the increasing figures regarding the number of soldiers killed on the ground are shown as evidence that Russian ground forces are involved in more comprehensive interventions. Kremlin: These individuals have no ties to the state While the Kremlin did not deny the news, it was stated that the individuals killed in the clashes in Syria were civilians and had no ties to the army. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the alleged mercenaries were voluntarily fighting for Bashar Assad and had no ties to the Russian Ministry of Defense. In a statement, Peskov said, “These individuals have no ties to the state.” Military casualties declared a state secret In Russia, a decree issued before the intervention in Syria declared military casualties suffered “in peacetime” a state secret. In addition to the publications in the country’s media that largely portray the intervention in a positive light, the actual data on Russian military casualties stands out as a sensitive topic. Reuters news agency also announced that the Russian Ministry of Defense and the Kremlin did not respond to questions it tried to reach about the news. Moscow began military operations in Syria in support of Bashar Assad approximately 2 years ago."}

Anuj Tiwari hired a nurse to manage the treatment of his brother who was turned away from many hospitals.Some hospitals said they had no beds left, while others said they could not take in new patients because they had run out of oxygen..There are patients dying in Delhi due to lack of oxygen cylinders.Hospitals in the city are in dire straits, issuing daily warnings about how many hours of oxygen they have left.The government takes action on these warnings and sends oxygen to the hospital by tanker, which will usually last for another day..Given the state of hospitals, Anuj Tiwari not only hired a nurse to care for his brother, but also paid a lot of money to buy a device that extracts oxygen from the air and concentrates it so that he can continue breathing..The doctor he saw also recommended that he obtain the anti-viral drug remdesivir..This drug, which has been granted emergency use authorization in India, is widely used by doctors.The effectiveness of this drug, which was originally produced against Ebola disease, against Covid-19 is still being debated worldwide..When Tiwari could not find the medicine in any pharmacy, he was forced to seek it on the black market.His brother's condition remains serious, and the doctor he consulted says he may need to be admitted to a hospital where he can receive remdesivir treatment..\"There is no bed.What do I do? I have spent so much money that I am left with nothing and I can't take it anywhere else!\" says Tiwari.Oxygen tanks and drugs such as remdesivir and tocilizumab are sold on the black market at much higher prices than normal Drugs on the black market: Remdesivir and tocilizumab Since remdesivir is not available, those trying to keep their patients alive at home are after this drug.Their patients need to be hospitalized and they want the medicine to be readily available if possible.Most black market drug dealers interviewed by the BBC said they were having trouble getting the drug in stock, forcing them to charge higher prices.The government has given permission to seven companies to manufacture remdesivir in India and asked them to increase production.But the promises on this issue do not seem to have had any practical impact yet..Epidemiologist Dr Lalit Kant says the decision to increase production is too late and the government should have started preparing for the second wave much earlier.\"But somehow the drug is on the black market.\"This shows that there is a leak in the supply chain that the state cannot control,\" he adds..Another drug used in Covid treatment in India is tocilizumab and there is a problem with its supply.This drug is a type of cortisone normally used to treat rheumatism, but there is some research that shows it can increase the chances of survival of very ill patients who need to be on a ventilator..Doctors give this drug to very sick patients, but it has disappeared from the market.Cipla, a company that imports the drug and distributes it in the country, is having difficulty meeting demand.Tocilizumab 400 mg normally costs 32,480 rupees.But Kamal Kumar paid 250 thousand rupees for a dose for his father.He says the price was \"mind-boggling\" but he was forced to pay out of desperation.But there are not many people in India who can pay this amount of money..Public health expert Anant Bhan says the government should buy medicines in large quantities and distribute them itself.\"There are very few people who can afford to pay the official price of the drug, let alone the black market price..This shows that there is no planning..The government failed to anticipate and plan what might happen.People were left to their fate,” he adds..Drug scammers, fake drugs Another problem is fake drugs.Fake remdesivir sold on the black market.When the BBC told a black market drug dealer that the drug he was selling was not licensed to be produced in India and that it looked like a fake, he was told: \"It's 100% genuine.\".Moreover, the writings on the medicine's packaging were full of spelling errors..But the seller shrugged and said we could take it to any lab we wanted and have it analyzed..The company mentioned on the packaging cannot be found anywhere on the internet..But people are in such desperation that they do not hesitate to buy even questionable products..People keep sharing phone numbers of people selling oxygen and medicine on social media, but no one checks their reliability.An IT (information technology) expert who did not want to give his name said that he was urgently trying to find an oxygen tank and remdesivir, and that he called a number on Twitter..When he contacted this person, he was asked to pay 10 thousand rupees as an advance payment..\"The moment I sent the money, this person blocked my number,\" he says.Desperation makes people more likely to believe anything, and that feeds the black market..Many state governments have pledged to crack down on the black market for remdesivir, and some have been arrested, but the black market does not appear to have been greatly affected..Anuj Tiwari, who is trying to keep his brother alive, says that they have no choice but to pay the money demanded in the situation they are in, and adds: \"It seems that there is no way to get treatment in the hospital and now you can't save your loved ones at home either.\"."}

In this respect, it is strongly recommended that our citizens residing in Syria return to their country.\" The Ministry noted that the difficulties caused by the developments in Syria, especially in terms of road travel, had been taken into consideration in previous announcements. It also reminded that warnings had been made not to use the road through Syria unless necessary and to travel during the day in cases of necessity. The announcement stated that in light of the recent developments in Syria, the consular service provided by the Consulate Branch of the Embassy in Damascus would be suspended as of 17:00 on Thursday, March 22, 2012.

According to the UN report based on data obtained from visits to the homes of approximately 150 thousand Syrian refugees living outside the camps in Jordan in 2014, one in every six refugees lives below the poverty line, on one dollar a day. The number of those who are in need of external assistance is increasing. End of news Guterres stated that freezing cold and power cuts are making the problem worse. The UN report stated that there was no heating in almost half of the houses visited for research, electricity was cut in a quarter and toilets did not work in 20 percent. The report, which drew attention to the fact that more than half of the housing expenses are made up of rent, noted that refugee families are forced to share houses in order to cut costs. Refugees are living with little or no electricity in freezing temperatures. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres is in Jordan to coordinate aid. Guterres, who met with Jordanian officials to coordinate the aid, said: “If the international community does not increase its aid to refugees, families will have to resort to very difficult means to cope. More children will drop out of school to work, and more women will be forced into exploitation, including sex, for money.” Most refugees in Jordan depend on food aid. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees reported that it is providing cash assistance to 21,000 of the most vulnerable Syrian families every month. It has been reported that since the end of 2014, an additional 10,000 families have been identified as poor enough to qualify for the aid, but aid has not been provided due to lack of resources."}

The opposition movement announced that they have collected more than 22 million signatures demanding Morsi's resignation. Eight people died The demonstrations, which continued throughout the night, are demanding that Morsi resign and early general elections. Hundreds of thousands of people in the capital Cairo gathered in front of Tahrir Square and the Presidential Palace. Some of the demonstrators stayed up all night. It was announced that eight people have died in the demonstrations since Sunday. Yesterday in Cairo, the headquarters of the ruling Muslim Brotherhood were attacked with stones and Molotov cocktails. The leaders of the demonstrators asked those participating in the demonstrations to stay on the streets until Morsi resigns. A presidential spokesman called on the protesters to respect the democratic process. According to Ahram News, Morsi supporters attacked protesters in the city of Beni Suef and an unidentified person opened fire on them. Demonstrations are also being held in other cities, including Alexandria and Suez. 'They will not leave the squares' BBC correspondent Alim Maqbol in Cairo says Egyptians have been preparing for these protests for weeks and the opposition is determined not to leave the squares until Morsi steps down and calls early elections. According to our correspondent, a large part of society also thinks that Morsi is an elected leader and that his term in office should be waited out. Our correspondent stresses that there is a serious division in society in this regard and that this is reflected in the streets. The protesters are reportedly criticizing the government for failing to resolve issues, particularly those related to the economy and security.

However, the site will first be quarantined and prepared for planting. Global demand for cocoa is increasing faster than production. In addition, around 30 percent of cocoa stocks cannot be harvested each year due to plant diseases and pests. The solution to this problem is considered to be developing new varieties of cocoa, and the work is concentrated at the International Cocoa Quarantine Centre. Since the University of Reading took over this work in 1985, all new cocoa seeds and plants to be quarantined have been moved to the facility near the university. End of news Harvest time \"One of the main issues in cocoa development is ensuring a reliable supply of clean, healthy and authentic cocoa samples,\" said Prof. Paul Hadley, cocoa project manager at the University of Reading. \"You need a mechanism to make sure that pests and diseases are not transferred when you transfer things,\" he said. The new purpose-built home, which cost more than $1.5 million, has been operating for a month. The International Cocoa Quarantine Centre combines a stock of 400 species into a single, improved greenhouse. The centre is expected to run the quarantine process faster, cheaper and more environmentally friendly. “We use a lot of energy to keep cocoa plants in tropical conditions, but we can do it more efficiently in our new facility,” Prof Hadley told the BBC. The centre’s location in the cool British climate is also crucial, protecting the cocoa from diseases that can affect cocoa in areas where it originated in South and Central America or the Caribbean. After a quarantine period of up to two years, the clean and safe cocoa seeds are sent from Reading to 20 other countries. 75 per cent of the cocoa used in chocolate worldwide is produced in West Africa. Cocoa harvesting plays a vital role in the region’s economy, with two million people working on the crop. Prof Hadley said the possibility of new pests and diseases being introduced to West Africa would “absolutely devastate the industry”. Chocolate crisis Despite efforts to keep these threats at bay, the global appetite for chocolate is already reaching levels that cocoa production cannot meet. “There are concerns about the relentless demand, particularly in countries like China where living standards are rising and people are turning to sweets more,” he said. “If something is not done, stocks will not be able to keep up with the rising demand,” he warned. But Prof Hadley believes the chocolate crisis can be averted. A lot of work and money is being spent on improving harvests and production. “Most cocoa is produced by farmers who are doing just enough to support themselves on one or two hectares of land. As well as the need for more efficient and new varieties, farmers also need to improve their methods of growing cocoa,” he said. “If we can combine those two things, I look at the future quite confidently. If nothing is done, there could be a crisis. “But there is a huge effort being made worldwide. Everyone is pitching in,” he adds. He relies on the Reading facility to ensure the continuity of his new cocoa production. Although he conducts extensive cocoa research at the university, Prof. Hadley said the centre’s rare collection is in the hands of “two technicians who are skilled in plant breeding”. “We are a small team with big responsibilities,” said Prof. Paul Hadley."}

Haddad's vote remained at 45 percent. Bolsonaro, who won votes by promising to end corruption and reduce crime in the country, is a name that has been the center of discussions with his statements both during the election campaign and throughout his political career. Bolsonaro has been likened to US President Donald Trump and is also known as the 'Trump of the Tropics' due to his approach to politics, his active use of Twitter and the policies he advocates. What policies does Bolsonaro advocate? Henrique Nogueira is among the voters who want Bolsonaro to relax individual gun laws. The right to bear arms for 'honest citizens' Far-right Bolsonaro promised to radically reduce Brazil's high crime rate during his election campaign. Bolsonaro, who describes himself as the presidential candidate who will make the streets of Brazil safe again, said that he will take steps to reduce the obstacles to individual gun ownership in order to ensure security in the country. Speaking on Rede TV on October 11, Bolsonaro said, \"All honest citizens, whether male or female, will be able to have a gun in their homes, subject to certain criteria.\" Another issue that was much discussed during Bolsonaro's election campaign, who is against abortion, was abortion. Known for his opposition to abortion, which is illegal in the country, Bolsonaro said in a Twitter message on October 12, \"Brazilian money will not be used to finance civil society organizations that encourage this work.\" It is being commented that Bolsonaro's stance on abortion has earned the far-right candidate the votes of Evangelical Christians in particular. Bolsonaro's supporters describe the far-right candidate as a superhero like 'Spider-Man' or 'Ironman.' ‘Market-friendly, nationalist economic approach’ Bolsonaro is thought to have garnered a lot of backlash in these elections. Brazilian voters who are unhappy with the economic policies of the leftist Workers’ Party are said to see Bolsonaro as an alternative. Bolsonaro’s economic policies, on the other hand, overlap with the approaches of other market-friendly right-wing governments in Latin America. Bolsonaro, who promises to reduce waste in the public sector, also promises to reduce state intervention in the market economy. However, the far-right leader occasionally makes nationalist statements about the economy. He thinks that sectors considered strategic in terms of national interests should remain under state control. Bolsonaro, a former captain, says he wants to implement a reform program that aims to reduce ‘unnecessary spending’. Bolsonaro said in a Twitter message, “We will reduce the number of ministries, close or privatize many facilities in public hands.” However, on October 9, during a television program he attended, he stated that he was against the privatization of the country’s electricity distribution company Electrobras, and that such a step could put the company into the hands of Chinese investors. Close relations with Donald Trump Bolsonaro is expected to follow a line similar to US President Donald Trump in foreign policy. Bolsonaro, who has said that Brazil could withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, argues that the terms of the agreement limit Brazil’s sovereignty and tie the government’s hands when it comes to decisions regarding the Amazon region. US President Trump also withdrew his country from the Paris Climate Change Agreement in June of last year. Bolsonaro’s stance was frequently criticized in columns in the press. The Sao Paulo-based Folha newspaper described Bolsonaro’s approach as an “anachronistic concern” in an editorial. However, it is stated that this approach to climate change has gained the support of landowners and has been positively reflected in Bolsonaro’s votes. Another approach of Bolsonaro that overlaps with Trump’s policies is his desire to move Brazil’s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He also says he wants to close the Palestinian embassy in Brazil, saying, \"Is Palestine a country? Palestine is not a country. So it shouldn't have an embassy here.\" The Palestinian Authority opened an embassy in the Brazilian capital Brasilia in 2016. Bolsonaro has also said that if he is elected president, he will make his first official visit abroad to Israel."}

This issue seems likely to cause important strategy discussions in the party in the coming period..We started yesterday to convey the strategy discussions in the CHP and addressed the answers to questions such as \"Is the CHP a Turkish party? What are its organizational problems?\".End of the news CLICK: THE DISCUSSION AWAITING THE CHP AFTER NOVEMBER 1st Although there are different approaches to \"reaching the other 75%\", there is a widespread opinion among experts who follow the CHP base and the party that the CHP needs to reach the base much more with different ways and methods..After stating that \"Today, the problem is not so much addressing conservative segments as reconciling these segments with the values ​​and segments of society represented by the CHP,\" METU Political Science and Public Administration Department faculty member Tarık Şengül says that it is not possible to achieve such a transformation by \"addressing them from the outside\": \"There is a need for an approach that touches these segments, talks to them, concerns themselves with their problems and solves them; essentially, this means activating leftist values ​​in a manner similar to the second half of the 1960s and the 1970s.\".\" 'Gaining trust is a process' Meanwhile, there is also the view that the CHP has actually moved beyond its traditional base, although this has not yet been reflected in the votes, and that this should be continued: Gökçe Pişkin, a member of the CHP youth organization who was also a member of the Party Assembly for a period, said, \"The CHP has actually moved beyond its traditional base..It has been able to do this with its innovative discourses, but it has not yet established the organizational channels that can spread these discourses further..Party schools, coming together with civil society, more home visits have borne serious fruit and will continue to do so..Gaining trust and growing the base is a process.\" he says.Alper Çelikel, a member of the Executive Board of SODEV (Social Democracy Foundation), says that going beyond 25 percent depends on an organization and a communication policy that enables the broadest participation of members..There are those who advocate the CHP's method of reaching the right-wing base through local governments, proving its ability to govern well, and marching to power..ODTÜ Academician Tarık Şengül believes that CHP can use the municipalities it controls in this way: \"If CHP is going to run for power in the upcoming period and will appeal to a wider social base for this, the most important leg of this project will be the municipalities..In this context, CHP municipalities need to redefine their priorities and projects by focusing on this goal..It is also worth remembering that the AKP came to power through municipalities..\" Yüksel Taşkın from Marmara University's Department of Political Science and International Relations is of the opinion that this method works and that implementing it systematically will pave the way for the CHP: \"For example, in Istanbul, the party's votes have increased significantly in the places where it has won municipalities since 2009..It seems that votes are being taken from the poor in these places..CLICK - WHY IS CHP HAVING DIFFICULTY IN REACHING NEW VOTERS? \"Look at the examples of Maltepe, Ataşehir, Kartal, Beylikdüzü, Sarıyere.After the municipality is taken over, the votes increase and votes are also received from the poor.CHP should do this in a very systematic way..People should see that there is power there and say, 'They have power and they are using it for me.'.\" Is there a need for reform in the organizational structure? A request to reform the organization may also be on the agenda during the congress process.This is considered important in terms of eliminating \"unrest and lack of motivation within the party\".Yüksel Taşkın from Marmara University advocates for the renewal of the CHP's organizational structure and says that Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu should take some risks: \"The current structures are very outdated structures.These are dynamic segments, white-collar workers, Gezi protesters, poor people, etc..can't add.Men over a certain age who have free time can engage in politics.I think the organization is failing, a very negative culture has been created, it only looks inward.The party organization is stuck in the old classical style.\"Apart from the current classical province-district structure, a subject-based structure is also needed..For example, if there is an issue related to urban transformation in a region, special work is required there..\" Alper Çelikel from SODEV also states that there is a need for a CHP where members have more say: \"In my opinion, the most important problem that the CHP needs to solve is that the discussion and decision-making mechanisms are kept very narrow.\".\"Members can only exercise limited activities such as voting in congresses and participating in election campaigns..Members are ineffective elements in the formation of party policies..The creator is in the position of a follower, not a creator..\"One of the most important criticisms during the June 7 and November 1 process, the 'deficiency of the organization in election work', needs to be read in this context..If you do not involve members in the policy making process, the level of ownership will decrease accordingly..\"The primary election system in the CHP was seen as a major democratization move in the party and was found positive..But there is criticism that \"an organized minority is disproportionately influential in the primaries.\".Yüksel Taşkın says the way to overcome this is to expand the organization quantitatively, especially with young people..Another important debate awaiting the CHP is the clarity of its policies regarding Turkey's vital problems..The Kurdish issue comes first..It is seen that Kılıçdaroğlu has brought a new perspective to the Kurdish issue after Baykal, but it is expressed that there is no concrete solution program..Although there is a tendency within the party to defend security policies on this issue, the \"SHP line\" that prioritizes a solution through democratic means is thought to be stronger..Yüksel Taşkın is of the opinion that the CHP should be more courageous on this issue, and even form a partnership with the HDP in the 2019 general elections, and that the CHP administration should convince its base of this now..What will be the ideological-political line of the CHP? The discussion of clarifying the ideological-political line of the CHP may also come to the agenda.According to the general opinion, CHP has turned towards a much more social democratic line, unlike the Deniz Baykal period when the understanding of nationalism was strong..However, the candidacy of Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu in the presidential elections and the nomination of some candidates from AKP and MHP origins in some cities in the local elections caused great debates within the party and criticisms of \"shifting to the right\"..The demand from the grassroots for the party to clarify its ideological-political line could cause a significant debate.In short, it seems that many ideological, political and organizational discussions await the CHP in the coming days..The results of these discussions will determine the CHP's place in Turkish politics in the coming period.."}

The bill prepared by Yanukovych's Party of Regions was approved in parliament yesterday. After proposals to amend the bill were ignored, Parliament Speaker Volodymyr Litvin submitted his resignation. Litvin's deputy Mykola Tomenko also announced that he would resign. During the second reading of the bill, a scuffle broke out between ruling and opposition deputies. The new law grants \"regional language\" status to Russian, the mother tongue of many people in the east and south of the country. Opponents of the regulation argue that it will weaken Ukraine's sovereignty and put the country back under Moscow's influence. The bill allows local authorities to use the regional language if the percentage of speakers of that language reaches 10 percent.

The Times also writes in its headline that the West is isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin by uniting over Crimea. The newspaper reports that the G7 leaders, who are meeting in The Hague, will not attend the G8 summit to be hosted by Putin in June, but will instead meet in Brussels. According to the Times, Russia found the decision \"meaningless.\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said there was no tragedy and that they would wait a year or two to see if it was worth continuing as a member of the G8. ‘G20 Should Also Take a Stand Against Russia’ According to the newspaper, Western diplomats are trying to mobilize the G20 countries to take a stand against Russia due to its annexation of Crimea and military troop buildup, and that this is not an issue between Russia and the G7, but rather a matter of complying with international law: “The West has so far been divided over the response to be given to Russia. While the United States has insisted on sanctions that will punish Putin’s inner circle, the European Union has targeted lower-level officials with travel bans and asset freezes due to differences of opinion among member states. British Foreign Secretary William Hague has announced that they are ready to ban Russian capital, even if it harms the financial markets.” The Financial Times newspaper also carries in its headline that it is estimated that the total amount of money that has fled Russia in the first three months of this year due to the annexation of Crimea is expected to reach 70 billion dollars. According to the newspaper, it is noted that many experts predict that the Russian economy will grow around 1 percent this year despite the crisis. ‘Ukraine Could Be a Disaster for Moscow’ Financial Times columnist Gideon Rachman writes that war with Ukraine could be a disaster for Russia: “In less than a week, Russia swallowed Crimea almost without firing a single shot and massed troops on Ukraine’s eastern border. All the West could give the Ukrainian army in return was ready-made food for the American armed forces. But the notion that Putin has won a great victory is misleading. He has taken a dangerous gamble and will lose if he tries to use force. Annexing Crimea is risky enough. But occupying eastern Ukraine would be disastrous for Russia.” Putin’s decision to seize Crimea was a desperate response to the Ukrainian revolution that the Kremlin could neither stop nor control. Putin decided to take action in Crimea so as not to go down in history as the helpless leader who watched ice dancing in Sochi while Russia lost Ukraine. The plan worked. A few days later, he was receiving a standing ovation and popular support began to grow.” “But by seizing Crimea, Russia ultimately ensured that it would lose Ukraine. If Ukraine holds elections in May, anti-Moscow voters will almost certainly come out at the ballot box because the Russian-speaking community in Crimea will not be able to vote.” ‘Shia fighters are changing the balance in Syria’ A report in the Financial Times reported that the number of foreign Shiite militants coming to fight alongside Bashar al-Assad has reached or even surpassed the number of Sunni militants in the country. The newspaper noted that these fighters, with Iranian backing, are better organised than the Sunni fighters. “The war in Syria has become woven into the fabric of the region’s Shiite societies. This presents both advantages and risks for Assad and his main backer, Iran. The number of Shiite fighters in Syria is estimated to range between 8,000 and 10,000.” \"Most of these militants come from Lebanon and Iraq. Some are even said to have come from Azerbaijan and Afghanistan. The presence of Shia fighters has contributed to the shifting balance in the three-year war in Syria. But the Shia mobilization could be detrimental to Assad. Initially, Sunni fighters supported the rebels' advance. But later, they pursued their own agenda and weakened the rebels fighting against Assad. If their interests conflict, Shia fighters could do the same.\""}
