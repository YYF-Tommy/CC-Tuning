This information was revealed by Fredrich Yunadi, Setya Novanto's lawyer, Wednesday (08/11), based on what he called a copy of the Letter of Notification of Commencement of Investigation (SPDP) numbered B/263/XI/2017/Dittipidum. Until this news was published, there had been no official response from Bareskrim Polri regarding the existence of the SPDP. The KPK spokesperson contacted by BBC Indonesia also did not answer phone calls. Early last October, Sandy Kurniawan, Fredrich Yunadi's partner, reported Agus Rahardjo and Saut Situmorang to the Criminal Investigation Unit, because they were considered to have falsified the letter extending the travel ban period for the Speaker of the Indonesian House of Representatives and the General Chair of the Golkar Party, Setya Novanto. The two KPK leaders were also considered to have committed the crime of abuse of office authority. The SPDP was shown by Fredrich Yunadi to journalists at the Criminal Investigation Unit office of the National Police. Several reports stated that Setya Novanto's travel ban was extended from October 2, 2017 to April 2, 2018 through a letter signed by the Chairman of the KPK, Agus Rahardjo. The ban was issued after Setya Novanto won a pretrial motion for his suspect status related to the alleged corruption case of the e-KTP project. And on Wednesday (08/11) afternoon, the SPDP was shown by Fredrich Yunadi to journalists at the Criminal Investigation Unit office, Central Jakarta, Wednesday (08/11). \"There is already an SPDP, who allegedly did it can be seen for yourself,\" said Fredrich. The SPDP, issued on Tuesday (07/11), was signed by the Director of General Crimes at Bareskrim, Brigadier General Herry Rudolf Nahak. It stated that investigators had found 'suspected criminal acts' as regulated in Article 263 of the Criminal Code in conjunction with Article 55 paragraph (1) point 1 of the Criminal Code and/or Article 421 of the Criminal Code. KPK: Does not affect investigation of e-KTP case The alleged criminal acts are two KPK leaders, Agus Rahardjo and Saut Situmorang. The letter was addressed to the Attorney General's Office and copied to the reporting party, the Head of Bareskrim, Karo Wassidik Bareskrim and the two reported persons. KPK spokesman Febri Diansyah stated that the report of the case to Bareskrim would not affect the KPK's work in investigating the e-KTP corruption case. \"The SPDP has also been submitted to Kuningan (KPK), so they already know,\" said Fredrich. KPK leaders have so far not provided any information regarding the SPDP. When the report of this case was submitted to Bareskrim in mid-October, KPK spokesman Febri Diansyah said that his party handed it over to the police to enforce the law fairly. He stated that the report of the case to Bareskrim would not affect the KPK's work in investigating the e-KTP corruption case. \"With this report, we assure the KPK that it will not stop working on investigating the corruption case of the electronic KTP project,\" Febri emphasized."}

In addition, according to the Interior Ministry, there was also a planned attack on Saudi police that was said to have been ordered by a leader of the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) group in Syria. Several suspects in the two planned attacks have been arrested, including a Saudi national, a Syrian national and two Pakistanis. Saudi players celebrated their victory over the United Arab Emirates at the stadium that was said to have been targeted with a bomb. Those who were said to have planned to attack the police were allegedly based in the Shaqra area and were all Saudi nationals. Security forces arrested them before they could carry out their actions. In addition to the suspects, six Saudis were also detained and questioned to determine whether they were connected to the group in Shaqra.

The US State Department says Hamza bin Laden is wanted because he is a key leader of an Islamist militant group. Several years ago, he released audio and video messages urging his followers to attack the US and its allies to avenge the killing of his father. Osama bin Laden was killed by US special forces in Pakistan in 2011. During his lifetime, Osama approved the September 11, 2001, attacks on the US that killed nearly 3,000 people. Hamza bin Laden, who is believed to be around 30 years old, was officially designated by the US as a global terrorist two years ago. He is married to the daughter of Mohammed Atta—the hijacker of one of the commercial airliners used in the September 11, 2001 attacks and crashed it into the World Trade Center in New York. Letters from Osama bin Laden seized from his home in Abbotabad, Pakistan—where he was killed in 2011—indicate that the late leader had been grooming Hamza to succeed him as al-Qaeda leader. Hamza was believed to be Osama’s favorite son, the State Department added. “We believe he may be on the Afghan-Pakistan border and … he will cross into Iran. But he could be anywhere in … southern Central Asia,” Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Michael Evanoff said. Hamza bin Laden is believed to have spent several years with his mother in Iran, where he is believed to have married. Other reports suggest he may have lived in Pakistan, Afghanistan or Syria."}

The national parliament passed the bill unanimously on Friday, but opposition lawmakers were absent after being expelled from parliament this week. Under the new law, any statement denying crimes committed by the communist regime that ruled from 1975 to 1979 is banned. Violators face a maximum prison sentence of two years. The bill was introduced by Prime Minister Hun Sen after an audio recording emerged of an opposition leader appearing to absolve the Khmer Rouge of responsibility for operating atrocities during its rule. 'The recording was doctored' In the recording, the opposition leader said Tuol Sleng prison was run by Vietnamese troops who overthrew the Khmer Rouge in an invasion in 1979 and was not run by the regime. But an opposition leader who is believed to be on the recording said his words had been doctored. The opposition, which was expelled from parliament for forming a new party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party, expressed \"disappointment\" at the bill's passage. The reason is that the ratification was taken without a quorum. Some critics say the new law risks being used as a weapon against the opposition ahead of the general election.

{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content into one sentence..\nSex: Not only fun but also risky!\nSex can carry the risk of heart attack.Sex: everyone – well, almost everyone – does it.But as with many other exciting activities, sex also has its own risks..Unwanted pregnancy and contracting disgusting diseases are some of the obvious risks, but there is also the risk of having a heart attack, getting hurt when the bed collapses, or even getting caught doing it in public! So what seems like a simple act (at least for some people) is actually quite complicated..That means we can start looking for some fun things to find out just how big a risk this bedroom scene is..Let's start, as most of us do, with simple unprotected sex between a man and a woman, and ask: what are the chances of getting pregnant? This is, for understandable reasons, rather difficult to study in laboratory conditions..One study in New Zealand that only allowed participants to have sex once a month, unsurprisingly, had a high dropout rate..Perhaps the study with the most robust number of participants was a European study that recruited 782 young couples who were not using artificial contraception and who carefully recorded the days of sex (and ouch!...so many days!) until 487 pregnancies occurred.The easiest way to estimate the chance of pregnancy is to consider only cycles in which there was only one sexual intercourse..The peak period for pregnancy appears to occur two days before ovulation: the chance of conceiving during this time is about 25%, which confirms previous estimates..But this chance decreases significantly on either side of the peak, to an average of 5% in other parts of the cycle..The bottom line is that one sexual encounter between a young couple has an average of one in 20 chance of pregnancy..This is based on the opportunity to do it on any day, as is usually the case with young people..Calculating success So, with this in mind, what are the chances of success for the average couple trying to have a baby? People who study how populations change are called demographers, and these experts use a rather academic term to describe the chances of getting pregnant in a single menstrual cycle: fertility..This of course varies between couples, but the average estimate is between 15% and 30% in high-income countries..Using this lower number, we can estimate that for a typical couple trying to have a child, there is an 85% chance of ending each month without conceiving..If we assume each month is the same and independent, then there are 0.85 x 0.85 (multiply by 12) the chance of not getting pregnant in one year of trying to get pregnant, which is 14%.So, in other words, 15% fertility means 100 – 14 = 86% chance of conceiving in one year..The figure of 90% is often quoted as the proportion of young couples who will conceive after one year of not using contraception, which corresponds to a fertility of 18%.Reducing the risk But let's say you don't want to get pregnant, the question then is how effective are the available forms of contraception? This is usually expressed as the pregnancy rate after one year of use, and depends, of course, on how carefully you use the contraception..Family planning tools such as contraceptive pills, intrauterine devices (IUDs), implants and injections are said to be 99% effective, so less than 1 in 100 birth control users will become pregnant after one year of use..Male condoms are about 98% effective when used correctly..Diaphragms (or female condoms) and cervical caps with spermicide are said to be 92-96% effective, which means between 4 and 8 women who use them will become pregnant each year..These figures are particularly important when trying to minimize the incidence of unwanted teenage pregnancies..In 1998 in England 41.000 girls aged 15-17 are pregnant.That means 47 pregnancies out of every 1.000 girls, or 1 in every 21 girls – or to give a more stark comparison – one girl in every average-sized class (in England the average class size used to be 20)..The UK government's efforts to halve this figure by 2010 were only partially successful; by 2009 the teenage pregnancy rate had fallen to 38 per 1.000 girls, or down 19% instead of the targeted 50%.Forty-nine percent of these teenage pregnancies end in abortion, but there are still many teenagers who give birth..In a 2001 UNICEF report, the UK had the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Europe at 30 births per 100,000 girls aged 15 to 19, with only the United States having a higher rate among high-income OECD countries, at 52 births per 100,000 girls aged 15 to 19..000.This is a stark contrast to countries such as Korea, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden, which have birth rates of less than seven per 1.000 teenagers.The Netherlands is just across the Channel from England, but their young people clearly have a different approach to sex..An unexciting ending Finally, we must not forget the risks of this exciting activity..Last year, researchers estimated that 1 in 45 heart attacks were triggered by sexual activity..Famous people such as Nelson Rockefeller, Errol Flynn, President Felix Faure of France, and at least two popes, are said to have died from this..Solo sexual activity has previously been associated with blindness and stunted growth, but there is limited evidence for this..However, if it involves asphyxiation or lack of oxygen, this is certainly not recommended, with a number of recorded fatalities, including actor David Carradine, singer Michael Hutchence and a British member of parliament..A study noted that there were 117 deaths in just two provinces in Canada due to this..The moral of all this may be that sex is not just a matter of morals but also of risk..You can read this article in English: Sex: What are the chances? on BBC Future"}

River, Belgrade, Serbia.Animals are at risk if they ingest plastic waste in rivers, lakes and oceans..In 2016, a group of scientists explored the shores of Lake Geneva in Switzerland..Their attention is not focused on flora or fauna, but on garbage..In particular, plastic waste.It is not difficult for them to collect used items that are thrown away by the general public..These objects include bottle caps, cotton buds, pens, toys, and straws..There are also chunks of styrofoam, which were once used to protect broken glassware..Collecting this waste is not the main goal of these scientists, says Montserrat Filella of the University of Geneva..In fact, they wanted to review whether the chemicals released by plastics in the lake could be categorized as dangerous..Their research comes as our world is currently in an uncomfortable position due to human-generated plastic pollution—from plastic deposits in the oceans to microplastics at the bottom of rivers..The concentration of plastic waste that almost covers the surface of the river in Bandung.As the UN has termed it, the Earth is facing a “planetary-scale crisis” that is destroying our ecosystems..Despite awareness of the dangers, plastic pollution has already become ubiquitous..While potential solutions are emerging, such as plastic-eating enzymes that might one day help humanity cut down on the amount of waste, there is no guarantee that they will be able to handle the millions of tons of waste already circulating in nature..Of all the types of plastic pollution, plastic pollution that pollutes the oceans has been studied and understood more than waste in fresh water..\"Freshwater systems are increasingly being studied, but the scale is much smaller than the study of ocean plastic pollution,\" Filella said..This may be because early studies focused on the ocean—so research proposals and research funding simply followed suit..It didn't take long for the Geneva team of scientists to find what they were looking for..Filella and his colleagues collected 3.000 samples and analyzed 670 of them.The results are quite worrying.Most of these samples contained toxic and hazardous elements, including cadmium, mercury, and lead..Some elements are now banned or have restricted circulation..In fact, the levels of toxic elements in some samples were \"extremely high\", as described in a paper published in the scientific journal Frontiers of Environmental Science..Waste piles up in a river in Bandung.This situation, according to Filella, \"reflects the length of time the plastic has been in the lake.\".The waste has been piling up for decades..In fact, as we know, plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose..The type of plastic found is exactly the same as the plastic that washes up on many coasts..However, there is one significant difference.Filella stressed that the hazardous elements in the plastics found by the research team in Lake Geneva \"appeared to be much higher\" than those in plastic samples in the ocean..The effect on wildlife is clearly a major concern..The presence of plastic in water and on the coasts of oceans, lakes and rivers means that plastic can be—and often is—ingested by wildlife..In fact, if animals swallow it, their stomach acid will try to digest the plastic as quickly as possible..As a consequence, hazardous elements in plastic will also emerge more quickly..Multiple studies show that sea turtles routinely die when chunks of plastic block their digestive tracts..Plastic can also damage the stomach, block the digestive tract, and cause species to die entangled in it..Because there have not been many adequate studies, it is not yet clearly known how freshwater animals can survive when they swallow plastic waste..Martin Wagner of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology spends much of his time researching the impact of plastic on freshwater animals..He found that freshwater species would suffer when exposed to high levels of microplastics..Filella suspects the scale is much larger.\"It may take a lot of plastic to kill water fleas, but that doesn't explain the long-term consequences and impact on the ecology..Plastic won't just go away.\"It's in the environment and it will stay there for decades,\" Filella said..Sunrise over Lake Geneva, Switzerland.Lake Geneva is not a unique example.A number of other lakes show similar levels of pollution..Plastic waste in Lake Garda, Italy, for example, is very large..A sample in the northern part of the lake contained 1.000 large plastic particles and 450 small particles (microplastics) per square meter.Microplastics, in particular, are silently deadly as highlighted in a 2015 study..Particles in microplastics are often 5 millimeters or even smaller..These objects are commonly found in lakes and river beds and animals may mistake them for food..Some microplastics come from plastic fibers in human clothing, others from cosmetic products that contain microbeads..A study even found microplastics in drinking water..However, the \"extent and relevance of its impacts on aquatic life\" is not yet well understood, the 2015 study said..Moreover, its impact on human health.This, according to the researchers who compiled the study, is \"disturbing.\".Lead researcher Dafne Eerkes-Medrano explained that when they looked for plastic pollution in fresh water, the amount was overwhelming..This they found even in remote Lake Hovsgol, Mongolia..Samples in the lake showed the number of microplastics reached 44.435 grains per square kilometer—almost as many microplastics as Lake Geneva, which reaches 48.146 grains per square kilometer.An analysis revealed that microplastics in the lake were carried by wind from parts of the lake inhabited by humans..Various types of waste pollute a lake in Colombo, Sri Lanka.It is now becoming increasingly clear that most of the plastic that ends up in the oceans starts in fresh water..One study estimated that the probability could reach 70% to 80%..The source of the pollution, says Martin Wagner of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, could be factories on the river banks..There is no single solution to our plastic problem, given the vast number of plastic products we use every day..This is why Wagner urges us all to “go back to the root of the problem”, thinking again about how we can reduce our consumption of plastic, from food packaging to drinking glasses..\"We must abandon the logic of producing, using and throwing away..\"We should instead try to create an economic system that makes all products reusable,\" he said..Reducing plastic use may reduce the amount of waste that washes up on our shores and we could argue that the plastic we use today is less harmful than plastic products of the past..However, as studies on plastic in Lake Geneva have shown, even plastic at the bottom of the river will continue to release toxic elements for decades to come..\"It may take decades to solve this problem,\" Filella said..You can read this article in English under the title Why plastics are not just an ocean problem on the BBC Future

Other officials reportedly said there were also militants from Singapore. Padilla said 11 soldiers, two police officers and 31 militants were killed, bringing the total toll to 46. The fighting erupted on Tuesday (23/05) after the Philippine military raided a house believed to be the hideout of Abu Sayyaf commander and leader of the Islamic State (IS) group, Isnilon Hapilon. Dozens of armed militants blocked government troops' advance, sparking fierce fighting in several parts of the city. Militants briefly raised the IS flag. The Philippine government's military operation was supported by helicopters and special forces. The government said the crisis was particularly difficult to contain because the militants had planted bombs on the streets and taken hostages. The militias are also on higher ground, allowing them to slow or halt the government offensive. Thousands flee As the fighting intensifies, thousands of residents flee. \"We are preparing for the test but all we hear is gunfire and bombs,\" a university student told Reuters news agency. Thousands of Marawi residents have fled the fighting that began on Tuesday. \"We are very scared. So are our brothers and sisters from the Muslim community.\" Marawi is a predominantly Muslim city in Lanao del Sur province on the island of Mindanao. The island is home to the Maute group, which has pledged allegiance to Islamic State. There is also a larger Muslim rebel group that wants greater autonomy from Manila. They are currently engaged in negotiations with the government, while smaller, more hardline groups remain active on the ground. The links between these smaller groups and like-minded groups in Indonesia and Malaysia go back several years, before Islamic State took hold in the Middle East.

The five Russian nuclear engineers killed last week were considered top experts and heroes.They knew the risks and designed the test beforehand, which was conducted under nearly impossible conditions..The information was said by Valentin Kostyukov, a senior official at Rosatom..He headed the nuclear center in Sarov, a secret Cold War-era facility where Russia made its hydrogen bomb..According to Kostyukov, the engineers who died in last week's explosion were Alexei Vyushin (designer and software expert), Yevgeny Korotayev (senior electrical engineer), and Vyacheslav Lipshev (head of the scientific test team)..The other two were Sergei Pichugin (a member of the test team) and Vladislav Yanovsky (deputy head of the scientific test department)..The Russian weapon called the 9M729 is said to have raised concerns among the US and a number of its allies..At the funeral, Rosatom's top man, Alexei Likhachev, said \"the best way to remember the five engineers is to continue the development of new weapons that can be completed without failure.\".Initially, the Russian Defense Ministry said the explosion that occurred on August 8 was triggered by rocket engine fuel..They said the blast killed two people, without detailing the identities of the victims..Rosatom later said the test used radionuclides that can emit radiation..They claim the technicians successfully completed the test run..But suddenly the fire broke out and exploded the engine..The victims were then thrown into the sea.Shortly after the explosion, the Severodvinsk city government reported a 40-minute increase in radiation in their area..The information prompted local residents to buy iodine at various pharmacies..Iodine pills are said to be able to protect humans from radioactivity..During the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986, demand for this drug was so high.The Russian missile test site at Nyonoksa was opened during the Soviet era..Ahead of last week's test, the Russian Defense Ministry created a no-go zone in the Dvina Bay, north of Nyonoksa..The area will remain closed to public shipping activities until next September..Norway-based online media, Barent Observer, said that a Russian ship specifically for transporting nuclear weapons was in the restricted zone the day after the explosion or on August 9..There has been speculation that the ship was deployed to collect radioactive debris after a failed test..However, the no-go zone was established to avoid the spillage of toxic rocket fuel into public fishing areas..Could the nuclear-powered missile change the world security map? Mark Galeotti said that there are currently many skeptical assessments that doubt that the Burevestnik missile can actually be created..Galeotti said another Russian missile, the Bulava, went through a series of failures in years of testing..Meanwhile, Zircon and Poseidon are follow-up projects..The Poseidon underwater drone program has now successfully created a prototype.However, like Burevestnik, Galeotti considered Poseideon to be an impractical weapon of mass destruction in a nuclear war..Two bombs made by the Soviet Union are on display at a museum in Sarov..Russia's state-run newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta last July described Burevestnik as a 'weapon of revenge'..The term was used by the Nazis for their weapons called V-rockets, which they launched at Britain during World War II..The newspaper said the Burevestnik is capable of long-term glide, while also evading air defense systems..They said the missile could destroy the enemy's vital infrastructure, shortly after a Russian ballistic missile exploded in enemy territory..On the other hand, Galeotti said the United States is now focused on developing medium-range missiles to anticipate war..The program was said to have been implemented after the end of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed by the US and the Soviet Union in 1987..\"The Russian military also wants to have that destructive power because they are also worried about China's development,\" Galeotti said.."}

But in an interview with MSNBC, Kellyanne Conway said Trump \"does not want to pursue an investigation\" into Clinton's emails. The comments also appeared to signal to Republicans in Congress to ignore the issue.

Clinton supporters argued that the FBI director's statement came too late and had a bearing on Clinton's defeat. In her MSNBC interview, Conway also noted that Clinton is still dealing with the fact that a majority of Americans think she is dishonest and/or untrustworthy. \"But if Donald Trump can help her heal, maybe that's a good thing,\" she said. She also hinted at a shift in Trump's political rhetoric since being elected president. \"I think he's thinking about a lot of different things as he prepares to be president of the United States and things that sound like campaign stuff are not part of it.\""}

Local club Al-Ittihad beat city rivals Hurriya 2-1 on Saturday. The meeting between the two local clubs was the first non-professional football match in Aleppo since the outbreak of war between the army and rebels in 2011. But the government regained control of the city last month in a major offensive. The match was a significant one for both clubs after a five-year hiatus. Ittihad's goalkeeper helped his team to a narrow victory - under a heavy police guard. The grass on the football pitch was brown and dull from the cold, and the damage to the stadium from bombs during the war was still visible - but the atmosphere was the same as at any other football match. The only signs of division in the city were the large posters of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and riot police standing outside the pitch. But the crowd remained optimistic, cheering over the sound of drumbeats and waving their team's flags. \"I can't tell you how it feels to be back playing (in Aleppo) after five years,\" Ittihad player Omar Hamidi told reporters before the game. \"My heart is beating very fast,\" he said. A portrait of the Syrian president was displayed above the stands. Riot police were stationed around the football pitch in anticipation of trouble. Hurriya player Firas Al-Ahmad said travelling from the coastal city of Latakia for the match - where his team plays this season - had affected his team's performance. However, he said he was happy to be back home. \"It's our right to play in Aleppo. And we play better in Aleppo. When we play on our pitch with our fans, it improves our performance. \"We want to make Aleppo a name again,\" he said. The return of football to Aleppo appears to ease organisational problems for the Syrian football league - which has so far only been able to hold matches in two major cities.

A website run by North Korean dissidents said senior officials were given Mein Kampf as gifts on Kim Jong-un's birthday in January. The New Focus International website quoted an unnamed North Korean official in China as saying: \"Saying that Hitler had rebuilt Germany in a short time after the defeat in World War I, Kim Jong-un issued an order that the Third Reich (or Nazi Germany) be studied in depth and that practical applications be drawn from it,\" the website quoted him as saying. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler wrote Mein Kampf in 1924 while he was in prison, describing his early life and racist views. The story has been translated into English as My Struggle. Physical threats But North Korea's Ministry of People's Security - which oversees security - strongly denied the allegations, condemning the dissidents as \"human scum\" and threatening to kill them. \"The ministry is determined to physically eliminate the despicable human beings involved in the betrayal.\" The statement added that defectors from North Korea were being exploited by South Korea and the United States. It is estimated that around 20,000 North Koreans have defected to the South since the 1950s. North and South Korea are still theoretically at war because they only signed an armistice after the end of the 1950-53 war, not a peace treaty. Relations have deteriorated since Pyongyang's nuclear test in February 2013. However, North Korea has agreed to resume talks with South Korea in early June."}

The strike is part of a campaign of similar action in a number of areas involving the NUT and NASUWT teaching unions. Teachers are angry about changes to their pensions, increased workloads and the government's plans to introduce performance-based pay from this autumn. NUT general secretary Christine Blower said: \"No teacher takes the decision to go on strike lightly, but the heavy-handedness of the Department for Education has left teachers with no choice. \"We cannot stand by and watch our profession being systematically attacked and undermined. \"There needs to be a change in the government's attitude towards teachers and education.\" Susi Artis, a spokesperson for the NUT in Nottingham, said: \"I recognise that for many parents this is deeply uncomfortable and we apologise for that. Strike action is a last resort.\" Ian Lever, of the NUT in Leicester, said: \"Teachers are furious about what is happening in the education system in this country and are prepared to protest. \"This is a relentless attack by the government, not just on our pay but on the education system in general.\" \"As professionals, as people who care about education, teachers are saying 'enough is enough', we have to do something about this.\" 'Reputational damage' The action is expected to affect schools in 49 authorities in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber. A Department for Education spokesman said: \"It is disappointing that the NUT and NASUWT are protesting against the government's policy of making headteachers pay their good teachers more. \"Strike action will disrupt the education of pupils, cause distress to parents and damage the reputation of schools in the public eye, at a time when our reforms are driving standards across the country.\" He added: \"In the latest survey, 61% of respondents supported performance pay for teachers and 70% were against or believed teachers should not be allowed to strike at all.\" The strikes are planned for London and the North East, South East and South West of England on October 17.

Voting took place in Cairo, Alexandria and eight other provinces, a week before it was held nationwide. Some 250,000 security personnel were deployed to ensure a safe environment. More than 51 million people are registered to vote. Polling had to be expanded because few judges were willing to oversee the referendum. Human rights groups have expressed fears that the results of the first round could sway those voting in the second round. Cars were set on fire The referendum asked Egyptians to accept or reject a basic document that must be ratified before elections are held early next year. The BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo says opponents of the bill argue that it is intended to impose Islamic law. He says the referendum is more than just a poll. It is about Egypt's future, whether it will be an Islamic state or a secular state. Both sides mobilized their supporters in the latest demonstrations on Friday. Clashes erupted in the city of Alexandria as activists fought with sticks, stones and other weapons. Cars were set on fire and 15 people were injured. The violence erupted after a cleric at a mosque urged worshippers to support the bill.

The report identified 112 business entities that the office said were involved in activities related to the settlements. The companies included Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia Group and Motorola Solutions. Palestinians said the report was a \"victory for international law\", but Israel called it \"shameful\". Some 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1967. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel has consistently denied this. Palestinians have long demanded their demolition, arguing that the settlements are on land they claim will be part of an independent Palestinian state, and their presence now makes it difficult to achieve that dream. Why Trump's Middle East plan is so divisive Last month, US President Donald Trump unveiled a peace plan that he said paved the way for Israel to take control of the settlements. In a speech to the UN Security Council on Tuesday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas reiterated his rejection of Trump's plan, calling it \"Swiss cheese\". But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the plan was \"the best plan ever for the Middle East... for the State of Israel and for the Palestinian people as well\". What's in the report? In 2016, the UN Human Rights Council mandated the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to compile a database of companies involved in certain settlement-related activities. The activities in question include: The OHCHR identified 112 business entities that, on reasonable grounds, have been involved in one or more of these activities. Of the entities named, 94 are domiciled in Israel and 18 in other countries - the US, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Thailand and the UK. \"The report confirms that this reference does not constitute and is not intended to constitute a judicial or quasi-judicial process,\" the OHCHR said. \"While the settlements are considered illegal under international law, this report does not constitute a legal characterization of the activities referred to, or the involvement of the companies in question,\" it added. What next steps are up to member states of the Human Rights Council. \"I recognise that this issue has been, and will continue to be, a highly contentious issue,\" said Michelle Bachelet, the high commissioner for human rights. What has been the reaction? Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said: \"The publication of the list of companies and entities operating in the settlements is a victory for international law.\" He also called on member states of the UN Human Rights Council to \"make recommendations and instructions to these companies to stop their work in the settlements\". Palestinians have rejected a peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump. Netanyahu said his country would retaliate against the report, tweeting: \"Anyone who boycotts us will be boycotted. We categorically reject this shameful attempt.\" The main body representing Jewish settlers, the Yesha Council, said the list contained \"clear anti-Semitic elements\" and stressed that the companies were \"working to strengthen the economy in the area and contribute to peace more than the UN has done in years\". Human Rights Watch said the list should serve as a warning to companies: \"Doing business with illegal settlements is akin to aiding war crimes.\" There was no immediate comment from the companies named on the list."}

than themselves.'Closed-end funds' — a long-term investment with money usually tied up for a minimum of five years — offer wealthy people access to big returns and high interest rates..Aircraft leasing is one of the areas with the greatest potential for investment, says Ian Marsh, CEO of London-based wealth management firm Fleming Family and Partners, which was originally set up to manage the fortune of Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond..The client worked with a company called Doric, which used the money to buy planes that it leased to major airlines such as Dubai-based Emirates Airlines..These investors will eventually get their money when the plane is sold, but they can earn 9% interest per year during the lease term..Compare that to the standard annual return for the Standard and Poor’s S&P 500 companies—America’s leading stock investment benchmark—of about 3%..Some closed-end funds require hundreds of thousands of dollars, but for an aircraft leasing fund, the start-up costs are quite reasonable, Marsh said..The SKY CLOUD investment series – which buys Airbus A380-800s and leases them to Emirates Airlines – has a minimum investment of 10.000 Euro (US$ 13.822) and a 5% fee, depending on the amount invested..Super-rich investors in the UK and elsewhere are also buying up farmland..As the human population increases, the demand for food increases and people with good agricultural land will benefit greatly, Marsh said..Fertile land is a limited resource: the harder it is to get, the greater the profit..According to Marsh, fertile land can generate returns of around 4% a year for investors and additional appreciation in value over time..Some investors may still invest in buying planes or buying farmland, but there are some long-term investments that offer investments in global infrastructure, such as wine..There are also several public companies whose shares you can buy on the capital market..For example, Gladstone Land is a United States

were still based in a shipping container,” he said..“You will meet the founders of the company once a week, get first-hand reports on what is going on and see the company grow..This could be a lot of fun.\"In addition, of course it can also be profitable.Investors who dare to invest their money are at great risk, 50% of start-ups or companies with partnerships fail completely, said Rose..A typical wealthy investor makes 20 to 50 times their initial investment in one or two successful companies..Rose herself usually invests between US$50.000 to US$100.000 in one company, and he claims to have earned millions of dollars from some of the investments he made..At this point, it's difficult for the average investor to invest their money directly in a business, unless it's a friend or family

huge profits, the key is finding something rare..According to Hudson company research, the value of hobby investments increased nearly 15% in 2013..There are several ways for the average investor to

That left Galatasaray needing five goals to beat the nine-time European champions and reach the semi-finals for the first time in 24 years. Emmanuel Eboue's equaliser levelled before Wesley Sneijder's strike and Didier Drogba's backheel left Real in the lurch.

The Delhi bus gang rape, which left the woman in critical condition, has sparked widespread protests across India. The government has tried to quell public anger by announcing a series of measures to make Delhi a safer city for women. These include increased police patrols at night, checks on bus drivers and their assistants and banning bus windows from being covered with curtains or paint. But protesters say the government's promise to punish the perpetrators with life imprisonment is not enough - they are calling for the death penalty. Six people, including the bus driver, have been arrested in connection with the rape. 'Justifying the anger' Protesters in Delhi are calling for the death penalty. The prime minister's brief message was delivered to the nation on television. \"I appeal to all concerned citizens to maintain peace and tranquility.

The government has also narrowed the estimated danger zone from previously six kilometers to a radius of four kilometers. \"Seeing a pattern like this, we see that if an eruption occurs, the threat is still within a radius of 4 km\", said Devy.

On the other hand, aid from the central government in Jakarta has also begun to flow to the interior of Asmat. Head of Public Health at the Asmat Regency Health Office, Steven Langi, said that data from four integrated teams for handling measles and malnutrition recorded that at least 63 children had died since September 2017 until now. However, this number is likely to increase as the reach of the integrated team that was sent to provide treatment and provide additional food assistance is expanded. \"Meanwhile, the team is moving through the field, focusing everything on 23 districts, so not only in the districts where [cases of measles and malnutrition] were found but throughout the districts,\" Steven told BBC Indonesia, Tuesday (16/01). Steven stated that of the total fatalities, four children died at the Agats Regional General Hospital (RSUD) and 59 children who died came from three districts, namely Fayit, Aswi, and Pulau Tiga. Given the large number of fatalities, the reach of the integrated team which was previously centered on seven districts has now been expanded to reach 23 districts to prevent the measles and malnutrition outbreaks from getting worse. \"There are several teams that have left, there are teams that are still on standby waiting for coordination because we also have to distribute, not only treatment but also food aid. Temporary reports from the Papua District Health Office, 471 people have measles and malnutrition. 15 patients due to malnutrition and measles are still being treated at the Agats Regional Hospital. Low health quality Steven admitted that the difficult terrain and lack of medical personnel are obstacles for the measles and malnutrition outbreak handling team and also make it difficult to predict the emergence of measles and malnutrition outbreaks. \"Areas like Pulau Tiga already have very few personnel,\" he said. Pulau Tiga District was the first place where fatalities due to malnutrition and measles were found. The difficult terrain and lack of medical personnel are thought to be the cause of the less than optimal handling of the outbreak. Previously, Bishop Aloysius Murwito from the Agats-Asmat Diocese said that 13 children with malnutrition died in Kampung As and Kampung Atat, Pulau Tiga District last December. Most of the victims died before they could be rushed to the hospital because of the distance between the village and Agats, the capital of Asmat, which can only be reached by water transportation. If using a speedboat, the distance between the two locations can be covered in three hours, but for local residents who row traditional boats, they will need to spend the night on the journey. According to him, the geographical conditions in the area are certainly a major challenge. On the other hand, the quality of health in Asmat is also low. \"For example, in As, Atat, the health center (pustu) officers have not been there for several months,\" said Aloysius. \"That's not a new song, but an old song. The dedication of the officers is weak,\" he added. Aid Begins to Flow On the other hand, aid from the central government in Jakarta has begun to arrive to handle the extraordinary measles and malnutrition incident in the interior of Papua, including from the Ministry of Social Affairs, the TNI, and the Surabaya City Government. According to Steven, the Surabaya City Government responded very quickly to the measles and malnutrition outbreaks that occurred in Asmat with assistance from the Mayor of Surabaya, Tri Rismaharini, which was sent on Saturday (13/01). \"They were the first to send aid from outside.\" \"They sent milk for baby needs and medicines and special nutrition for those who are malnourished,\" he added. Additional food assistance is not only for children, but also for breastfeeding mothers. Furthermore, Steven explained that a team of doctors from the Indonesian Army had also arrived in Asmat with around 10 specialist doctors who would treat patients being treated at the Agats Regional Hospital. The specialist doctors include internal medicine, skin diseases, pediatricians and nutritionists. \"Then later there will also be a team deployed in the field,\" explained Steven.

A single goal scored by Marko Arnautovic in the 53rd minute knocked the Blues—Chelsea's nickname—down to 16th place, two levels above the relegation zone, with 11 points or 14 points behind the leader of the standings, Manchester City. For Mourinho, the seventh defeat in the first 12 Premier League matches was the first experienced as a manager. The record was also the first for Chelsea since the London club was relegated to Division 1 in the 1978-1979 season. This condition has caused speculation that Mourinho will be fired to blow even harder. Previously, media reports in England last week stated that Mourinho's fate could be determined after Chelsea faced Stoke and Liverpool. If Chelsea loses again, it is likely that the board of directors is ready to terminate Mourinho's contract early. Speculation that Jose Mourinho will be fired is blowing even harder. Goal chances When facing Stoke at the Britannia Stadium, Chelsea actually had a number of chances from the actions of Pedro, Loic Remy, Diego Costa, and Ramires. However, the brilliance of Stoke City goalkeeper Jack Butland's performance made those chances disappear. On the other hand, Stoke City was able to present a real threat to Chelsea's goal guarded by Asmir Begovic. The peak occurred in the 53rd minute, when Arnautovic's acrobatic action shook Chelsea's goal net. Mourinho himself could not do much because he was forced to watch the match from his hotel room. This was because the man from Portugal was banned from attending matches at the stadium when his team played once after speaking with referee Jon Moss in the match against West Ham on October 24. Tactical and strategic directions when Mourinho was absent were given by the Chelsea coaching team, namely Steve Holland, Rui Faria, and Silvino Louro."}

The hacking and tapping were revealed in the trial of the NOTW wiretapping case - whose operations have been closed by Murdoch - in London, Thursday (20/12). Among the things that were tapped were four voice mails or voice boxes left by Prince William for Kate, who was William's girlfriend at the time. Among them, William called Kate with the greeting 'babykins'. In another message, William said that he was almost shot with blank bullets while taking part in training at his military barracks. For the first time, the jury learned that members of the royal family were victims of the NOTW weekly wiretapping. Two former NOTW editors-in-chief, Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks, were brought to trial along with five others and faced a number of charges. In the UK, this case attracted attention, not only because it involved members of the royal family but also because Coulson had worked in the public communications department of Prime Minister David Cameron's office.

The chairman of the committee, Nick Barley, said that the festival, which will be held until August 26, is the best compared to previous years. According to him, this is indicated by the large number of enthusiasts who have purchased festival tickets. More than 800 writers from all over the world will take part in around 700 events at this festival for literature lovers. All of these events are held in Charlotte Square Park in Edinburgh, Scotland. Barley, who has been chairman of the committee for the past four years, said that the success of this festival cannot be separated from the success of previous events. Author JK Rowling Jenny Brown, chairman of the committee at the first festival in 1983, said that at that time there was no event like this in Scotland, and there were only two other similar events in the UK. Currently, he continued, there are more than 300 similar events. That is why, according to him, it is understandable that the Edinburgh Book Festival deserves to be called the largest book festival in the world. \"And surprisingly, we had an interesting event, attended by famous writers like John Updike and Anthony Burgess, and people really liked it.\" In the course of the Edinburgh Book Festival, according to Barley, it has given birth to many talented writers in Scotland in the last 30 years. He then mentioned several names of writers, who in 1983 had not published their books but are now widely known throughout the world, such as Ian Rankin, Alexander McCall Smith, Irvine Welsh, James Kelman and JK Rowling. The 2013 Edinburgh Book Festival, which officially opened on Saturday (10/08) and will last for 17 days, is expected to be flooded with 200,000 visitors."}

In the previous season, Di Matteo was Chelsea's main assistant coach Villas-Boas, before he was finally appointed to replace the Portuguese man. Villas-Boas, who is 35 years old, was fired by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovic in early March because he was considered to have failed to improve the achievements of the west London club. Under Di Matteo's leadership, Chelsea was able to win the 2011 Champions League. Although unemployed for a while, Villas-Boas was finally recruited by Tottenham Hotspur as the main coach since this season was held in August 2012. Like Chelsea who have never been defeated this season, Spurs under coach Villas-Boas have performed convincingly. Sitting in fifth place in the Premier League standings, Tottenham have won four times in the last match, including when Germany Defoe and his friends beat MU 3-2 at Old Trafford. This is Spurs' first away win over MU in the last 23 years. Ambitious Meanwhile, Chelsea is still the leader of the standings with 19 points from six wins and one draw. Roberto Di Matteo, as quoted on Chelsea's official website, said that the match this evening is very meaningful: \"This is a very important week for us\". Chelsea has never won at Spurs' home in the last six matches. According to him, the London derby is a 'war' between two clubs who are both ambitious to be number one in the English Premier League. \"They are ambitious to be number one, while we also insist on staying at the top of the standings,\" said Di Matteo. Responding to the figure of Villas-Boas, Di Matteo admitted that he was not surprised when the Portuguese man was again trusted to be a coach. \"He is a talented coach,\" said the former Italian national team player. Focus on the team He himself said that the match this evening was not an event for revenge based on personal problems. \"I myself am more focused on our own team, their players, the way they play...\" Roberto di Matteo, Chelsea coach. \"This is the first time we have met in a match. I am more focused on our own team, their players, the way they play...\" \"We have a very good relationship, but in tomorrow's match (Saturday, 20/10), we will beat each other,\" he said with a laugh. Meanwhile, as quoted by the official Tottenham Hotspur website, Spurs coach Andre Villas-Boas said that his team has the advantage as the host when facing his former club, Chelsea. He hopes that the support of Spurs supporters will be additional ammunition for Jermain Defoe and his friends to make Chelsea helpless. \"Our stadium is a special place for the kids, because thousands of our supporters will continue to give support,\" said Andre. So far Chelsea have never won at White Hart Lane in their last six Premier League matches, although Lampard and his friends were able to beat Spurs 5-1 in the FA Cup semi-finals last season.

Psychologically, people during the last legislative election said 'Sir, we'll just wait for the presidential election'. Well, now we are waiting for that,\" he said via telephone, Wednesday, July 2.

In the last legislative election, the level of participation of Indonesian citizens in Malaysia was low even though various polling stations (TPS) were provided. The enthusiasm of citizens in the presidential election was also felt in Hong Kong. According to the Chairperson of the International Migrant Alliance Eni Lestari, Indonesian workers have expressed their determination to cast their votes both through polling stations and by post. \"Currently, we see quite high enthusiasm for voting, perhaps because there is a new profile, namely Mr. Jokowi.

However, she continued, many Indonesian workers in Hong Kong have not received information about the presidential election, among other things because not all of them have access to social media while some of the information is disseminated via Facebook. Most Overseas Election Committees will hold presidential elections this weekend, including in Hong Kong and Malaysia.

The two countries have taken their dispute over spying in an energy deal to the UN court. The case stems from claims that Australia's intelligence agency ASIS installed spying devices in East Timor's cabinet offices, under the pretext of repairs, to obtain information about a 2004 Timor Sea gas deal. The Timor Sea Maritime Arrangements Treaty (CMATS) governs how gas reserves are shared between Australia and East Timor.

Before the restrictions were implemented, the densely populated island nation already had a series of strict policies aimed at limiting the number of cars on the road. As a result, car ownership rates in Singapore were much lower than in other wealthy countries. Licensing system In addition to the planned car cap, Singapore has implemented a policy of deliberately raising the cost of owning a car in order to reduce the number of vehicles on the road. This is done by creating a system that requires prospective car owners to apply for a limited period of ownership and use of a vehicle, known as a Certificate of Entitlement (COE). As a result, mid-range cars in Singapore typically cost about four times as much as similar cars in the United States. The LTA said the new restrictions would not significantly affect the number of COEs available, as most COEs are owned by existing car owners who are renewing their licenses. The new growth cap is slightly lower than the COE quota of 0.25%, which has been in place since 2015. It applies to private cars and motorbikes, but not to freight cars and buses. In numbers: Cars in Singapore Public transport boom Despite government policies, there are almost a million vehicles on Singapore’s roads. More than 600,000 of them are private and rental cars, including those used by ride-hailing services such as Uber and Grab. The LTA says there are limitations to expanding the tiny nation’s road network. Roads take up 12% of the country’s land area, a much higher percentage than many other countries of a much larger size. In addition to the vehicle growth cap, the government is trying to tackle congestion by investing heavily in the country’s public transport network. It has added 41 new train stations over the past six years, expanding the country’s network by 30%.

whisper, as thin as tissue and impossible to recapture..Talent plays a key role, but so does precise timing, judgment and incredible luck..In the case of Amy Winehouse's Back to Black album, released 10 years ago, her talent was undeniable, but her personal judgment was questionable even as her artistic decisions were unimpeachable: her timing was certainly a blessing; and her fortunes swung from bad to good, and back again with renewed passion..The autobiographical material is self-explanatory: girl meets boy, then boy is in a relationship he doesn't want to end, but the attraction between them is too strong to overcome..The boy's ambivalent feelings fuel the girl's feelings of inferiority..The only escape for the girl is to drink or do drugs until she feels different..Back to Black has sold over 12 million copies worldwide.This condition leads to a series of dark, drunken episodes and culminates in the intervention of friends and family..They tried to encourage him to take care of himself..Deep in the throes of addiction and with a mastery of denial built from her lifelong attempts to hide an eating disorder, she insisted she was fine..In a state of desperation, he threw everything, absolutely everything, into the lyrics of a song for his new album as his only salvation..It was at this point that his talent took over..All 11 songs written by Amy Winehouse for Back to Black are poetic responses to chaotic feelings..Sometimes the lyrics are philosophical and self-assured - as on Love is a Losing Game - sometimes they are harsh and violent..Her raspy voice crafts calm from the chaos of the situation, giving her - and her listeners - a sense of control over her broken heart..The voice he produces is also a way of coming to terms with some incredibly powerful emotions by detailing his darkest sides, his most depraved actions; detailed with a very alert eye and forensic attention to detail..Listening to You Know I'm No Good will put anyone further into that picture than they ever wanted to..And those real-life details were one of the key factors that fueled the album's success at the time..While Amy was still a big fan of jazz, soul, and gospel, she used the emotional elements of early 20th century music as the basis for her songwriting style..The lyrics are inspired by the brutal honesty and toughness of hip hop..It's an influence she's happy to show, especially on Me & Mr Jones, with its references to rappers Slick Rick and Nas, using an irreverence that never quite messes up the notes of an Ella Fitzgerald or Billie Holiday song..Black and blues Another key factor, and a more controversial one, was the opulence of the arrangements..Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi attempt to place Amy's words into a sumptuous musical setting..Ronson's focus was to create a Motown effect by bringing in the Dap-Kings to create arrangements that referenced those used by vocal groups The Supremes and The Temptations..This arrangement can be heard in the song Back to Black.Meanwhile, Remi draws inspiration from slightly broader black music..This inspiration can be heard in the song Tears Dry on their Own, the sad song Some Unholy War, and the Lovers' Rock style beat in Just Friends..Amy Winehouse, Juni 2004.Ultimately, the two producers tried to match the pressure of Amy's lyrics with an undeniable vitality of soul, which made her bleak stories seem more relatable and contributed in no small part to the album's popularity..Some might argue that these attempts at sweetening up the songs detract from their meaning, burying the poetry and truth of Amy's words under a neat retro-soul gloss, rather than honing in on all their raw edges..But it's worth noting that sampling music from old records to create new ones really fits with Amy's love of classic hip hop and soul..In a way, it gives him a solid exterior..Only Amy Winehouse could write a song when she was torn or vulnerable like Back to Black.The cornerstone of this approach was Rehab, the first single from the Back to Black album and the song that ensured that Amy Winehouse would remain a media sensation for the rest of her life..This is a song of perfect timing, Ray Charles' cornered rebellious nature reborn from the mouth of a frustrated, heartbroken woman from London..And while the song spawned a million cheap insults against the singer in the months that followed, its power lay in the two-fingered salute of rebellion with which he wrote it, and the ruthless commercial exploitation of his personal life that soon followed..Just before the moment of inspiration struck, Mark Ronson had already spoken to Amy Winehouse about his father's efforts to overcome his alcohol addiction..In an interview with BBC Radio 1, Mark revealed that Amy said \"'She tried to take me to rehab and my reaction was, 'Uhh..no, no, no\".The sentence immediately popped into his head, and made him realize that he had been a bad friend but a good producer..\"I mean it should be like, 'How did that (rehabilitation) effort impact you?'.I just said \"We have to get back to the studio..'\" Through honesty aided by aesthetics, Amy Winehouse's most famous song was born, for better or worse..It's one of the main reasons Back to Black stands alone alongside nearly every other album released in 2006..Many artists dig up dusty old jazz ballads or retro soul, and many of them will happily claim to have written honest songs..Adele then promptly appeared and took over the world with her equally apt blend of rhythm and blues and romantic rants, leaving Joss Stone and Duffy wondering what Amy had that they didn't..But very few of them have lives as extreme as Amy's, and even fewer would admit to every bruise and scar that doesn't look pretty, whether through art or otherwise..Maybe they could write Tears Dry on Their On, but only Amy Winehouse could write a song about being torn or vulnerable like Back to Black, while preparing her romantic suicide note with bitter wisdom and stubbornness..Amy Winehouse, Juni 2007.There is an accusation that honesty is just a veil to cover something up, a way of hiding the worse truth in plain sight, under a barrage of cheap reporting..Yes he's heartbroken, yes he's a drunk, yes he had some problems in his childhood and yes he's capable of extreme acts..But while she mentions her lovers, her drinking, her drug use, her adventurous urges, and even her father in her songs, none of Amy Winehouse's lyrics are about food or eating disorders, and that is certainly her free choice..But even without that hidden narrative, as an album Back to Black speaks to so many people because we all share the inner monologue that we are odd creatures and don't deserve our good fortune..Even without experiencing a fraction of the things written on the album's lyric sheets, we all carry with us the notion that we are messed up, flawed individuals who feel we can't be justified in doing the wrong thing..If love is a game that we are sure to lose, what we need is advice from someone who has gone bankrupt, gambled everything they have, and lost..You can read this article in English, What Amy's music really revealed on BBC Culture."}

The desire to recruit Guardiola is said to be because the London club's owner, Roman Abramovich, is losing patience with interim manager Rafael Benitez, following the 0-2 defeat to Swansea in the League Cup. The Daily Express reported that if the Spanish coach accepts the offer to become manager at Stamford Bridge, he will receive a salary of £18 million per season on a three-year contract. This offer would make Guardiola the highest-paid football coach. However, The Sun reported that Guardiola may still reject the offer of a salary of £300,000 per week because Chelsea often change managers. Targeted by many clubs, Guardiola - who left Barcelona in the middle of last season - has reportedly not been contacted directly by Chelsea. Benitez is expected to remain as interim coach until the end of the season. The former Liverpool manager is also unpopular with Chelsea fans, many of whom are still unable to accept the sacking of Roberto Di Matteo. In addition to Chelsea, Guardiola is also being targeted by several other clubs including Manchester City, Arsenal and several Italian clubs.

One in five athletes surveyed said their oral health was seriously damaging their training and performance. The research, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, found that cavities, tooth erosion and gum disease were common problems. Researchers said athletes had worse dental health than others of the same age. The beaming smiles of gold medal winners Usain Bolt, Jessica Ennis-Hill and Mo Farah are just a few of the memories from the London 2012 Olympics. But the team at University College London said many of their competitors had dental problems. Affecting careers \"Our data and other studies show that, for a similar age profile, athletes' oral health is poor. And it's quite striking,\" said lead researcher Professor Ian Needleman. He said regular consumption of large amounts of carbohydrates, including sugary energy drinks, was damaging teeth. Of the 302 athletes assessed across 25 sports, 55% had evidence of cavities, 45% had tooth erosion and 76% had gum disease. One in three athletes said their oral health was affecting their quality of life and one in five said it was affecting their training or athletic performance. Oral health is linked to other health conditions such as heart disease. People who do not brush their teeth twice a day are at higher risk of heart attacks and inflammation in general. The researchers suggest other inflammation in the body may also affect recovery time and susceptibility to injury. They added that toothache and the resulting impact on eating and sleeping patterns could also be detrimental to athletes' performance.

The Indonesian government is currently still evaluating the extent of the damage in order to immediately determine restoration and rehabilitation steps. The Indonesian government will also file a lawsuit against the Noble Caledonia shipping company in the near future. According to the Director General of Marine Spatial Management of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Brahmantya Poerwadi, after knowing the total area and type of coral damaged by being hit by the MV Caledonian Sky, the government will also assess the multiplier effect (multiple impacts) caused and the opportunity lost (cost of lost opportunities) from the incident. \"Multiplier effect, for example, there used to be a schooling ground for fish. Because there is no place anymore, maybe there is no income from fisheries. The tourism side constraints are also very detrimental there. We will also evaluate that. How much do they get a year?\" said Brahmantya. \"And we must detail this lost opportunity until the coral rehabilitation is complete, the estimated time until they return to normal,\" added Brahmantya. From the extent of the damage, the government can then make a budget for coral reef restoration and rehabilitation which can take up to 20 years. \"Coral grows at the fastest five centimeters per year, determined by the habitat and sea water conditions.

Whether the details will prevent the ship from moving will be determined. We will also summon the main and local agencies for initial fact finding and a lawsuit against Caledonian Sky,\" explained Brahmantya. The ship is currently in the Philippines. The permit to leave, and previously enter the waters of Raja Ampat, was given by the Jayapura Harbor Master. \"The ship was released with permission from the harbor master. That will be asked later in the meeting (coordination at the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs),\" said Brahmantya. Previously reported that Noble Caledonia would be asked to pay compensation of US$1.28 million (around Rp17 billion to US$1.92 million (around Rp25 billion)) to restore the condition of Raja Ampat. However, Brahmantya said the amount would still be evaluated again after obtaining actual data from the field. \"Actually, cases of ships hitting coral are not the first time. In Indonesia, there have been barges crashing in Sulawesi, in Batam, in Karimun. The scale of the ship is different. Some have replaced it for several billion rupiah. \"This case is a little different, there is a large cruise ship that has crashed with several consequences, so it cannot be instant, it must go through a process and stages,\" said Zulficar Mochtar, Head of the Research Agency of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. The damage to the coral reef is estimated to reach 1,600 square meters. Noble Caledonia's apology The cruise ship company Noble Caledonia apologized for the incident that occurred and promised to pay for the losses that arose. \"We are currently working with experts to see how we can help the coral reef regenerate. We apologize for the impact this has had on the local community,\" the press release said. \"Noble Caledonia has set up a fund to help the local community and contribute to the repair of the coral reef. We are also looking to send our expedition team to help regenerate the coral reef.\" \"In addition, we have insurance and our insurance company is working with the Indonesian government and coral reef assessment experts.

The next day at midday, the ship headed towards Bitung and hit a coral reef at a depth of five meters in the waters off Kri Island. According to the captain's statement, the ship ran aground because he only relied on GPS and radar without taking into account the tides. Based on preliminary estimates, the area of ​​damaged coral reefs reached 1,600m2 due to the movement of the MV Caledonian Sky trying to get out of the stranded area, not because it was pulled by a tug boat. The ship was released by the Jayapura Harbor Master on March 5."}

Lawyers can now argue that what their clients did was related to their mental condition..Of course, in general it is difficult to know what factors determine the decisions taken by the judges..\"Cases like this are very complicated..\"There are so many factors involved,\" said Deborah Denno, a law professor at Fordham University in New York..\"Genetic conditions are one of perhaps 50 variables that judges consider..\"Genetics may play a role in decisions for Waldroup cases.However, there are other things that also have an influence..A spokesperson \"confirmed\" that the genetic condition mattered, but said how Waldroup was raised and the hardships he suffered as a child to become the person he is today also played a role..\"We will never know for sure what makes someone decide to do something,\" said Denno..The judges themselves, perhaps, don't know for sure..Virtual jury Because it is difficult to study the impact of genetic conditions directly from the courtroom, some researchers are taking other steps..They moved him to the lab..Nicholas Scurich of the University of California and Irvine and Paul Appelbaum of Columbia University asked 640 volunteers from various locations in the United States to serve as virtual jurors..Each jury must render a verdict regarding a gun crime..Scurich and Appelbaum created a number of options: related to whether the defendant was a minor or an adult, the severity of the victim's condition, the attorney's defense, and whether or not the defendant had a certain genetic condition..Jurors gave significantly shorter sentences if the defendant was a minor, or if the victim's condition was less severe..However, genetic conditions have no effect whatsoever on the length of the sentence imposed..It turns out that the general public still cannot accept the use of scientific data in trials..The actual courtroom also showed similar results..Paul Catley and Lisa Claydon of the Open University in the UK, looked at 84 cases in England and Wales involving the perpetrator's genetic condition..It turns out that only 22 of them had an impact on the defendant's verdict..The majority do not.Denno said the findings were not surprising..He has studied hundreds of cases in various trials in America involving the genetic conditions of the perpetrators..\"More than 800 cases were studied and genetic conditions were found to have no effect on the decision..\"We can only speculate as to why the results were as they were..Last year, Scurich and Appelbaum said the complexity of understanding genetic factors makes juries less likely to care about them..Meanwhile, a philosophy professor from the University of Utah, James Tabery, stated that the genetic condition of the perpetrator had no effect, because most people still find it difficult to believe scientific evidence..For example, it is very difficult to get people to agree that the actions we take are related to how our genes are conditioned..Mentalizing effect However, it is possible that genetic conditions do influence decisions..But ironically, it will simultaneously encourage the jury to hand down a harsher verdict, so that in the end it will be the same; it has no effect..For example like this.If a judge or jury agrees that genetic factors influenced a defendant's actions, they may give a lighter sentence..However, the jury or judge can still give a high sentence, so that the defendant does not do the same thing if he is released, because his condition makes it possible for him to repeat his crime..And it could also be that genetic conditions actually worsen the verdict for the accused..It turns out that judges and juries do not always consider genetic factors and scientific data when drawing conclusions..In 2012, Tabery released the results of a study similar to Scurich and Appelbaum's research..The case is about a man who was diagnosed with a psychopathic condition, and was found guilty of committing a serious crime..Tabery questioned 181 judges in the United States about the appropriate sentence..The judges on average stated that for the victim's condition as stated, they would sentence the perpetrator to nine years in prison..However, when it was stated that the perpetrator was a psychopath, the sentence was increased to 14 years in prison..The sentence was slightly reduced to 13 years in prison, when the judge and jury were told that the psychopathic condition was related to a person's genetic condition that he could not change..\"The results of the diagnosis related to psychopathy actually make the sentence even heavier,\" said Tabery..\"Although additional information regarding the condition slightly reduces the verdict.\"The reason, according to him, is because the judges are worried that if they are released quickly, the perpetrators will do the same thing again.\".This result clearly contradicts Denno's conclusion..Denno also said that there was an error in Tabery's research..Denno said the error was related to the choice of psychopathy in Tabery's research, which \"already has a bad stigma in society.\".Tabery did not deny the criticism..However, he does not agree that the results of his research should not be considered in studies on genetic conditions and their relation to legal decisions..The reason is, the research uses the opinions of judges, not general volunteers who do not have adequate legal knowledge..Genetics determines who we are.However, genes are not the only factor..So, is the lack of convictions in Waldroup's case really related to his genetics? It's hard to know..If we look at it from Denno's research, it doesn't seem that.And if we look at Tabery's study, Waldroup's verdict should have been much harsher..But what is clear is that the use of biological and genetic conditions seems to be starting to be used as a weapon by lawyers to defend their clients..And this is something that is acceptable from a legal perspective..Although, the general public doesn't seem to be able to accept it with open arms..You can read the English version of this article on BBC Future under the title The controversial debut of genes in criminal cases."}

When she was told that she had won the UNICEF comic competition, instead of being happy, Rizka panicked. \"I immediately thought about school, I wasn't happy, I panicked, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to focus on school because of this,\" Rizka told BBC News Indonesia. The reason is that as a third-grader at SMA Negeri 2 Makassar, in a few months Rizka will soon face graduation exams, and college entrance selection. She wants to enter the Indonesian Institute of the Arts in Yogyakarta, or the Bandung Institute of Technology majoring in DKV. Drawing is Rizka's way of expressing her feelings. Rizka explained that she is actually a shy child. \"People say I'm quiet, hard to talk to, cold, but I'm actually shy and afraid to talk to people,\" she said. That's why she's been drawing since she was little. Some of her comics, usually comedies, have been uploaded to various platforms, such as Instagram, 1cak, or DevianArt. Creating an anti-bullying superhero, Indonesian student wins world comic competition The comics that Rizka makes are mostly based on her daily experiences. As a teenage girl, she witnessed a lot of bullying and violence around her. \"I once had the experience of being a victim of seniority when I was in first grade, at that time my classmates were also victims,\" ​​said Rizka. However, at that time Rizka felt she couldn't do anything \"because it had become a habit\". Rizka also felt that many women around her had difficulty speaking up when faced with violence, bullying or sexual harassment. \"For example, my female friends are often catcalled, they are whistled at by people on the street, that's sexual harassment. They feel uncomfortable, but if they report it, people's response is \"why are you reporting it?\" So they are confused about where to report it,\" said Rizka. Comics made by Rizka. As a teenage girl, Rizka has had similar experiences. \"As a girl, I often get catcalled when I go to or from school, and even though I have reprimanded the perpetrators, they don't want to listen and instead consider us a threat to them. I'm worried when things like that happen,\" she said. Rizka explained that when she reprimanded the perpetrators of verbal harassment, she was the one who was cursed. \"I reprimanded them using Makassarese, I told them to stop. I said, \"do you think that's fun?\" but I was the one who was attacked back. Oh well,\" she said. These experiences led her to create the character Cipta. Cipta is a 15-year-old girl character, still in junior high school, who has the superpower to make pictures come alive and control them. Cipta tries to reduce the violence that occurs around her. \"So for example, she makes one object, she controls it to protect the people around her,\" said Rizka. Cipta becomes an alternative power to help others talk about violence that befalls them or those around them. Rizka tells about bullying in her comic. The idea of ​​Cipta's power actually came about because of deadline pressure. Rizka admitted to being influenced by the comics and games she had read so far. \"I took a power that is rarely found in other characters, but also one that is simple and does not burden junior high school students,\" she said. \"With Cipta, I hope to inspire at least one other person to dare to speak up for themselves or others, in their own way. Like Cipta with her drawings,\" said Rizka. If they can't help others who have problems, according to Risca, at least they can listen to other people's problems. Now Rizka, assisted by a team of professional comic artists, will prepare a complete comic book about Cipta.

The reason, as a Defense Ministry official said, is that South Korea is short of military personnel as its population declines. By 2023, South Korea is expected to have a shortage of between 20,000 and 30,000 military personnel. Since the Korean War ended more than 60 years ago, every South Korean male citizen aged 18 to 35 was required to serve in the military for two years. Engineering and science students are typically exempted from military service as part of an effort to strengthen South Korea’s industry. South and North Korea are technically still at war because their conflict ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty. With that exemption, and because some men choose to serve in the police or fire department, about 28,000 men are exempt from military service. An official told South Korea's official Yonhap news agency that the exemption rule would be phased out and would be abolished altogether by 2023. Military service has caused a stir in the entertainment world as artists have tried to shirk their duties and caused public outrage, including Psy, who shot to fame with his hit song \"Gangnam Style.\""}

A local hospital board member, Banemanie Traore, said that although the government had given permission for the hospital to be built, it was ultimately not allowed to open. Traore believes the health ministry intervened to stop the project for religious reasons. He said the country's powerful Catholic group was pressuring the government. \"They don't want women to enjoy sex.\" Traore said 130 million African women have been mutilated and cannot enjoy sex and that hospitals should be allowed if they wanted to build them. Government bans hospital because it is considered proselytizing Don't proselytize Burkino Faso's Health Minister Lene Sebego told Reuters that \"health organisations should focus on saving lives rather than promoting religion.\" The Raelians, who have raised $400,000, believe in UFOs and that our purpose on earth is to enjoy ourselves. Meanwhile, a team of American doctors working on a voluntary basis has arrived in the country and now they have no place to perform the surgery. \"I came because I believe that female genital mutilation is a crime against humanity,\" said Dr. Marci Bowers, one of the five members of the American medical team. Regardless of the debate, it is clear that Burkina Faso's women are being deprived of the opportunity to have surgery to treat the effects of mutilation."}

To tip or not to tip? That is the question that continues to haunt consumers of services such as Instacart (fast grocery delivery in the US), or Washio (laundry delivery in the US) or TaskRabbit (odd-job services in the home environment; available in the US and UK) and Airtasker (the same as TaskRabbit but in Australia)..According to TaskRabbit managers, tipping is up to the customer..The answer isn't always clear-cut. TaskRabbit, Airtasker and Washio all say there's no need to tip their workers for services rendered..TaskRabbit did try to provide a tip option on its initial platform but that option was removed last year..“If a client is satisfied with the service provided, they can leave a tip in cash, Paypal or Venmo,” says Rabbit’s chief marketing officer, Jamie Viggiano..He added, “tipping is entirely the consumer's decision.”.“Meanwhile, Airtasker is in the process of introducing a tipping feature on its platform, explained co-founder Tim Fung, who said the move was based on user feedback..Instacart actively encourages users to leave tips for their grocery staff either directly or through an option provided to consumers via email sent after each delivery..Tipping options range from 5% to 15% of total spend..Dinner tip? New sites like EatWith and VizEat that let users book dinners with locals in their homes are being called the “Airbnb of home-cooked meals” provided by more than 200,000 people..000 home cooks in 50 countries participated.But should customers be expected to tip? EatWith communications director Naama Shefi insists that guests are not expected to leave a tip for the host..“Instead, we encourage them to write reviews about their experiences,” he said..“That way, potential guests will gain from the experiences of previous guests and hosts will get a higher ranking in search results.”.” VizEat co-founder Camille Rumani agrees with that..He argued that not tipping was “key to maintaining the authenticity of the encounter.”.Instead, what we encourage is for guests to bring a gift for the host, just as you would if you were having dinner at a friend's house..This is much friendlier and leaves a stronger impression than a tip..” Tipping for accommodation? Many travelers leave change or bills for hotel housekeeping staff, but is it appropriate — or should it be the norm — to leave something when booking a home-sharing service like Airbnb or HomeAway? Diane Gottsman, a Texas-based expert on modern etiquette, says hosts often don’t expect tips because the cost of cleaning the room is often built into the rate..However, what they are hoping for are positive reviews because that is how people will be able to find them, Gottsman said..Brooklyn residents Jimmy Lawler and his wife Georgette don't leave tips for Airbnb hosts, but always bring a souvenir from home as a keepsake..“Usually a New York City magnet or a bottle opener or something like that,” Lawler explains..“It's just a way of saying thank you and leaving a little piece of our world in their home..” In conclusion, of course, how much we tip for services like these - and when we tip - likely depends on where in the world we are..“I think it’s really important to take culture and customs into consideration when we travel because every country has its own standards,” Gottsman said..“When in doubt… being polite is never considered rude.”.” The English version of this article, Is this the end of tipping? can be read on BBC Capital."}

The party's executive board members will be banned from politics for the next 10 years, and Thai Raksa Chart will no longer be able to compete in future elections. \"The monarchy is above politics, and in order to maintain political neutrality, the king, queen and princesses will never be able to exercise their political rights by casting their votes,\" Justice Nakharin Mektrairat said at the end of the ruling. Thai Raksa Chart is backed by exiled former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a military coup in 2006. Analysts say disbanding the party will make it harder for Thaksin's supporters to win a national election due later this month. Thailand is ruled by the military, which seized power in a coup five years ago. Ubolratana is the elder sister of Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn. A royal candidate would have given Thaksin Shinawatra loyalists a clear advantage in the upcoming election, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok. The court ruling has dashed hopes of Thaksin's supporters winning enough parliamentary seats to achieve their aim of winning a majority in the next election, our correspondent says. Thai Raksa Chart is seen as a proxy for Pheu Thai, the main pro-Thaksin party, to gain more seats in parliament, analysts say. A new law introduced in 2017 set a threshold for how many seats each party can contest. The vote on 24 March will be the first since the current prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, came to power in a military coup in 2014 - overthrowing a democratically elected government. Who is Ubolratana Mahidol? Born in 1951, the first daughter of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej has the full name Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi. After marrying an American man in 1972, she gave up her royal title. Uboratana moved to the US. When the marriage ended, Ubolratana returned to Thailand and returned to participating in royal life. Ubolratana is active on social media. She has also starred in several Thai-made films. Ubolratana has three children, one of whom died when the tsunami hit Thailand in 2004.

But occasional cannabis use does not appear to lead to a decline in performance. The research is based on a long-term study that tracked the health of people born in the Bristol area in the 1990s. But it warns that it is difficult to distinguish the specific effects of cannabis alongside other \"risky behaviours\" such as drinking alcohol. \"It's hard to know what's causing it. Are these kids doing badly at school because they're smoking cannabis, or is it because they're smoking cannabis that they're bad at it? This research shows that we can't just blame cannabis as the main cause,\" said lead researcher Claire Mokrysz, from University College London.

The news of his death - known for Good Morning Vietnam, Mrs Doubtfire and the TV series Mork and Mindy - came as a shock to many, despite his earlier revelations that he had problems with alcohol and drugs and depression. The latest reports said that Williams was suffering from early-stage Parkinson's on Friday (15/08). But his death has also raised questions about whether mental health issues are given the same priority as physical illnesses. A discussion on the Today programme featured Adrian Strain, whose son took his own life aged 34. He spoke about the fact that most people know little about mental health issues, and as a parent he had always worried whether he had done enough to cope. Tributes to Robin Williams from fans The programme also interviewed Sir Simon Wessely, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. He noted that society was “apparently more accepting” of people with physical illnesses such as high blood pressure or cancer getting treatment or being aware of medical treatments for those conditions. Meanwhile, only 40% of people with mental health problems were getting medical treatment. Prof Wessely said the issue was particularly complex, with people who knew they had mental health problems reluctant to speak up for fear of losing their jobs. There was also a call for more attention to mental health issues in the discussion. The case of Robin Williams, who died by hanging, gave new impetus to the discussion about treating depression."}

Several people were reported injured in the incident, some believed to have been hit by rubber bullets. The police operation came hours after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan ordered authorities to halt the protests. He said Taxi Square should be \"evacuated\" ahead of a counter-protest by his Justice and Development party on Sunday. However, protesters from the Public Workers' Union KESK said they would go ahead with their strike on Monday, while other groups were still deciding whether to join the protests. 'Peaceful environment' The protests in Istanbul began with protests against plans to rebuild Gezi Park, which they saw as an Islamization of the government. They have since evolved into an anti-government movement that is seen as increasingly authoritarian. Protesters have previously vowed to stay in the park until their demands are met. But it took Turkish riot police just half an hour early on Saturday to end the 18-day occupation of the park. Police officers wearing gas masks and carrying riot shields moved slowly amid a cloud of tear gas, the BBC reported. Most protesters left the park to avoid injury. Some regrouped on nearby roads, but police fired more tear gas to disperse them. After the crowds were dispersed, police tore down tents and banners held by the protesters. Istanbul Governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu described the operation as \"smooth\" and said 29 people were lightly injured. \"We will continue our work to build a peaceful environment in the coming hours,\" he added.

The restrictions are also being imposed on people who have problems with the urge to steal and chronic gambling. Psychiatrists and human rights lawyers in Russia have opposed the new rules.

Valery Evtushenko of the Russian Psychiatric Association expressed concern to BBC Russian about the restrictions on driving licenses. He said the rules would discourage people from seeking psychiatric help for fear of being banned from driving.

The carcasses of the mother and her calf were found by rangers in a village in Garissa County, a region in northeastern Kenya. The reserve where the giraffes lived is a large, unfenced area. There are also several villages within the reserve. News of the white giraffes' existence spread around the world after they were photographed in 2017. Before the two white giraffes were found dead, Mohammed Ahmednoor, the area manager of the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Game Reserve, said they were last seen more than three months ago. \"This is a very sad day for the Ijara community and Kenya as a whole. We are the only community in the world that takes care of white giraffes,\" said Ahmednoor. \"The killing of the two is a blow to the extraordinary efforts made by the community to care for this rare and unique species. It is a wake-up call for continued conservation efforts,\" he added. The mother and her calf lived in a large, unfenced area. The poachers who killed the giraffes have not been identified. Their motives are also unclear. The Kenya Wildlife Society, Kenya's largest conservation body, said it would investigate the killings. The condition that caused the giraffes to have white skin is called leucism. What is leucism?

It's become clear that Roman's recipe is the latest in a long line of recipes that have become hugely popular as a result of being shared..It's just that before the internet came along, the way recipes were shared was through newspapers and word of mouth, not Twitter and Instagram..\"Recipes have been 'trending' long before the internet,\" explains Dr. Kimberly Voss, a professor at the University of Central Florida and author of The Food Section: Newspaper Woman and the Culinary Community..\"There was a certain point in time where it was all about showing off, like Julia Child's early days..\"There was kind of a prestige for home cooks to make something that required a lot of skill or fancy ingredients, which I think still exists,\" Voss said..And, as in 2019, what makes a recipe popular is being part of the club of people who make it..\"There's also this idea of ​​following these cool people, and that kind of pressure - if everyone else is making this dish, you should too..\"The \"German\" in this chocolate cake is not a country of origin, but a brand..And they are often driven by food brands, as much as by food editors and recipe developers..Take for example German Chocolate Cake, a recipe that has nothing to do with Germany, but instead derives from \"German's Chocolate Cake\", taken from German's Sweet Chocolate Baking Bar, a product made by confectioner Baker.This recipe was published in the Dallas Morning News in June 1957 by George Clay and became so widely requested that Baker Chocolate began distributing it to other newspapers, resulting in a surge in chocolate cake sales..With the rise of social media, documenting your home cooking efforts is a way to signal that you're on top of current trends..\"Now if you can't take a good picture, are you really making it? Recipes are a form of communication, and part of that is being known,\" Voss said..What's next? But in terms of what's going viral, not much has changed..Yes, today's home cooks have access to many ingredients that were not widely available in the 1950s and 1960s..But from his studies, Voss notes that the patterns that become popular usually have to do with push-and-pull efforts between big food companies and the food media..\"After World War II, every two years we got excited and then got bored of making our own bread,\" Voss said..Many of the things that are popular are determined by the attitudes of a given society towards fitness and health, or the gadgets that every home cook is excited about these days..There's a reason why there are so many Instant Pot recipes these days..There's no way to predict specifically what will be the next German's Chocolate Cake or #TheStew, as tastes and food trends fluctuate..One constant? \"The only thing I've found that remains popular is bacon,\" Voss says..Recipe developers, take note!

Abdullah al-Badrani, also known as Abu Ayoub al-Atar, was reportedly killed in a US-led coalition strike on Thursday (04/13). Al-Badrani issued a series of orders to members of the group, which led to torture, deaths and sexual violence against civilians. Iraqi security forces are currently working to retake the al-Nuri mosque in the old city. The Iraqi government has issued orders for civilians to stay safe as security forces continue their assault on ISIS-held areas in the western part of the city. Mjasid Al-Nuri is a key target because it is where ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi first made his presence felt after declaring a caliphate spanning Iraq and Syria in 2014. Who is the ISIS mufti? By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab Affairs Editor The so-called Islamic State (IS) has been feared and reviled for its atrocities and human rights abuses against entire communities. Abu Ayoub al-Atar has a notorious reputation in Mosul and has issued decrees that go beyond religious matters – he has authorised a number of these acts. He is believed to have justified the enslavement and sexual violence of women from the Yazidi minority in northern Iraq. In recent years, he has authorised IS to continue its attacks on civilians in eastern Mosul, which has been retaken by Iraqi forces.

He did not say how Ri responded. Saturday's resolution, which banned North Korean exports and restricted investment in the country, was unanimously passed. Wang said UN sanctions were necessary but \"not the ultimate goal,\" and he urged dialogue. He said he had asked North Korea to remain calm and not provoke the international community with another missile test. The Chinese ambassador also urged the US and South Korea not to escalate tensions, saying the situation was at a \"critical juncture\" but also a point where talks could resume. US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley has previously said that North Korea is facing \"the most severe sanctions a country has faced in a generation.\" Pyongyang tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July, and said it now has the capability to strike anywhere in the US. But experts doubt their missiles will be able to hit their targets. The test was condemned by South Korea, Japan and the United States, and prompted the drafting of the new UN sanctions. What are the new sanctions? China, North Korea’s sole international ally and a veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council, voted in favor of the resolution after negotiations with the US that Haley described as “difficult.” Beijing has often shielded Pyongyang from dangerous resolutions in the past. Russia, which has also been criticized by the US for its economic ties to North Korea, also voted for the sanctions. Top diplomats including US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are gathering for a regional forum under the auspices of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the Philippine capital, Manila. North Korea’s nuclear program is expected to be a major issue but there are no plans for a bilateral meeting between Tillerson and a North Korean representative. Speaking earlier as he sat down for talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, Tillerson said the sanctions were a “good outcome.” 'Costly for the regime' US President Donald Trump tweeted that the sanctions would cost the North more than $1 billion. Exports of coal, ore and other raw materials to China are one of North Korea's few sources of income. It is estimated that North Korea exports about $3 billion of goods annually - and the sanctions could cut that trade by $1 billion. But China's participation will be key and top US diplomats have said they will keep a close eye on Beijing to ensure it complies with the sanctions. Earlier this year, China cut off coal imports to increase pressure on Pyongyang. But repeated sanctions have so far failed to deter North Korea from continuing its missile development. Beijing has also been angered by the installation of a US-funded missile defence system in South Korea. North Korea has not officially responded to the new sanctions. A senior official told South Korea's Yonhap news agency: \"We will make our position clear when things are determined.\" But the ruling party newspaper Rodong Sinmun has previously said sanctions or unilateral action by Washington on missiles and nuclear weapons would lead to an \"unimaginable sea of ​​fire\" engulfing the United States. The internationally isolated country's missile and nuclear tests violate UN resolutions and have been condemned by its neighbors in the region. But South Korea has said it could hold direct talks with North Korea during the ASEAN summit. Its foreign minister said he was willing to talk to his Pyongyang counterpart if the opportunity \"naturally arises.\" In all, 27 countries are sending representatives to the ASEAN Regional Forum. The 10 ASEAN members issued a joint statement saying they had \"deep concerns\" over North Korea's actions, which \"seriously threaten peace.\""}

The case, which has rocked Afghanistan and sparked international concern, was uncovered by two activists, Musa Mahmudi and Ehsanullah Hamidi. Both were arrested by intelligence agencies before being released. Mahmudi told the British newspaper, The Guardian, that at least 546 boys were allegedly sexually abused by a pedophile ring involving teachers and officials. Several victims told The Guardian, the US newspaper The New York Times and the independent Afghan news channel ToloNews about their experiences. The Guardian also reported that some of the victims had been \"killed\". It also said that activists had obtained more than 100 pieces of evidence in the form of video recordings. One of the victims, a 14-year-old boy, told The New York Times that a teacher called him and told him that he would pass an exam if he \"did a small favor\" for the teacher. The teenager said the teacher \"took her into the school library, locked the door and raped her\". At the same school, a 17-year-old boy said he had \"experienced the same thing from the principal\". He said the principal \"would kill him if he told anyone about what happened to him\". 'Need immediate investigation' Activists conducted interviews with victims and found that \"in just three schools in Logar, at least 165 male students had reported being sexually abused in the school premises\". After the case became public, intelligence agencies arrested two activists, Mahmudi and Hamidi, on the grounds of \"disturbing public order\". Afghan President Ashraf Ghani called for an immediate investigation. The intelligence agency said \"the claims made by Mahmudi and Hamidi were part of an attempt to seek asylum abroad\". It also called the case of the two activists \"completely baseless\". Pressure from various parties led to Mahmudi and Hamidi's release. Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, said the president was \"deeply disturbed\" by the intelligence agency's interference in the case. He said the president wanted an immediate investigation. \"The president wants to make sure that agencies and institutions like the Independent Human Rights Commission, the Interior Ministry and related institutions conduct investigations,\" Sediqqi told the BBC on Wednesday. He said all parties in Afghanistan agreed to end sexual abuse and that anyone responsible should be brought to justice. \"We all understand that there is a problem, so we have to find a solution to solve it. The law and the constitution are clear. Everyone, not just the government, should know what happened. We have to work together to solve it,\" Sediqqi said. Robert A. Destro, an official at the US State Department, said the US government was \"deeply concerned\" and was following the case closely. He urged the Afghan government to \"take action to protect the victims and bring the perpetrators to justice.\" According to AFP, parts of Afghanistan still tolerate the practice of bacha pazi, which uses boys or young men as sex slaves. Boys are forced to dress in women's clothing and are made to dance by adult men before being raped. Sometimes, the boys are auctioned off and handed over to the highest bidder.

This request came in response to the heating up of demonstrations in several cities in China followed by a series of acts of destruction of Japanese-related assets in the country. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated in the past year after the South China Sea conflict resurfaced and has not found a middle ground. In its latest statement, the Japanese government said it had the right to ownership of three disputed islands (called the Senkaku Islands in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese) from the previous owner of the islands, a Japanese businessman. The islands have become the source of the dispute because they are thought to be rich in gas. In the demonstration on Saturday (15/9), angry mobs stormed the Japanese embassy in Beijing, throwing rocks at the embassy building. In other cities, Japanese-owned shops were looted while Japanese-branded vehicles were damaged and burned.

{"instruction": "Summarise the following content into one sentence.\nIn Libya, weapons are being sold on Facebook\nLibyan militias are using social media to buy weapons, or sell their old ones. The 18-month study found that a range of weapons – from handguns to rocket-propelled grenades – were being sold in “closed” or “secret” Facebook groups. The illicit arms trade is a breach of Facebook’s terms of service, and a Facebook spokesperson said it encouraged users to report such cases. The study used data collected by Armament Research Services (ARES) from 1,346 transactions. The researchers believe this is only a fraction of the actual amount of trade on social media. The report was released on Thursday (07/04), but BBC Newsnight understands it has received a copy in advance. The late Muammar Gaddafi was an obsessive arms buyer and tightly controlled the market. During his 40 years in power, he is estimated to have spent more than $30bn (£25bn) on weapons. Examples of weapons sold on Facebook. When rebel forces overthrew his regime in 2011, Gaddafi’s weapons stockpile was freely sold on the black market. Researchers believe that trading on social media began in 2013, and the market has continued to grow. They tracked the trade in small arms on social media sites including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Telegram. The largest volume of sales was found on Facebook. The majority of the weapons traded were pistols or rifles. The most popular type of rifle was the Kalashnikov, which sold for an average of 1,800 Libyan dinars (£1,000). “While the majority of the items traded were traditional small arms – pistols through to rifles and machine guns – there were also more significant weapons systems that could have an impact on the battlefield or be used by terrorists,” said one of the researchers, Nic Jenzen-Jones from ARES. “Manpads are anti-aircraft systems. We found not only complete systems, but also individual components… They are not particularly effective against modern fighter aircraft, but they pose a significant threat to civilian aircraft.” The researchers found that anti-aircraft systems were priced at up to 85,000 Libyan dinars (about $60,000). One offer included an anti-aircraft gun fitted to a truck. ‘Closed’ and ‘Secret’ Much of the trade is concentrated in the major cities, especially Tripoli, Benghazi and Sabratha. Buyers are a mix of militias buying weapons to fight in the war, and militias getting rid of their weapons because they no longer need them. Most sellers are in their 20s or 30s, and transactions are often completed via private message or phone call. Most of the weapons are advertised in “closed” or “secret” Facebook groups – and therefore only visible to members of the group. The number of members in a group varies from 400 to almost 1,400. Some groups have clear names, such as the now-defunct The Libians Firearms Market, and many were still active 18 months into the study – suggesting, the researchers say, that such groups are rarely reported to the site’s administrators. In a press release, a Facebook spokesperson said, “Arms trafficking is against our Community Standards, and we remove such content as soon as we become aware of it. We encourage users to use the reporting link so our teams can take action immediately.” Researchers believe most of the arms transactions are taking place domestically. However, the European police agency Europol is concerned about some weapons entering Europe from Libya."}

But the Israeli actress recently explained to Jimmy Kimmel that the correct way to pronounce her name is Gal Gad-dott. She’s not the only one who struggles with name pronunciation. Here are other celebrities whose names are often mispronounced. JK Rowling The correct pronunciation of JK Rowling’s name is Rolling, like you would say the Rolling Stones. About 20 years ago, no one knew about Harry Potter author JK Rowling. But as her fame grew, so did her big name. How do you pronounce Rowling? Is it Row-ling or Rowl-ling?

Mamma Mia! star Amanda Seyfried is a regular at correcting people on how to pronounce her name. Sig-frid, Say-frid, Sig-fred and Sey-frid have all been uttered in front of her, and she cringes every time her name is said. She explained in a 2012 interview that the correct pronunciation for her name is Say-fred. Martin Scorsese The name of the famous director Martin Scorsese is one of the most difficult celebrity names to pronounce. Everyone knows that the pronunciation of Scorsese is Skor-sey-zi, right? Wrong. The correct pronunciation is Skor-sess-si. The director said it during the fifth season of the television drama Entourage. Barbra Streisand Singer Barbra Streisand once complained to Tim Cook that the Siri app on Apple devices was not pronouncing her name correctly. Last year Barbra Streisand made headlines after she complained to Apple CEO Tim Cook about the way Siri pronounced her name. According to her, Siri pronounced Streisand like most people do: Strei-zand. \"She mispronounced my name,\" the singer told NPR. \"Streisand with a soft S, like sand on the beach.\" So the pronunciation is Strai-sand. Shia LaBeouf The pronunciation of Shia LaBeouf's name is Shy-a La-Buf. Shia LaBeouf famously covered his head with a paper bag at the Berlin Film Festival in 2014, saying he was no longer famous. But when talking about the incident, people were forced to say his name - which was a bit tricky for some. His name should be pronounced Shaya-La-Baf, not Shi-ya La Buf. Charlize Theron It turns out Charlize Theron's name in Afrikaans is even more complicated: Shar-leeze Thrawn. The South African actress has struggled to correct people to get her name right. Not Ther-on or Ther-own (the same pronunciation as Throne) - but Ther-in. Confusingly, it's not even her real name. In Afrikaans, her name is pronounced Syar-liz Thrawn, but she chose Ther-in because she thought it was easier to pronounce. She told Piers Morgan how to pronounce her name correctly. Matt Groening The Simpsons creator also has a tricky name to pronounce. Simpsons creator Matt Groening has a name that's going to confuse you.

Although considered not too severe, the number of cases of children being hit by TVs is increasing. The researchers said the increase in cases - collected from 1990 to 2011 - is not solely due to the increasing number of TVs in America. \"We suspect the increase in cases is due to changes in the location of TVs in the home,\" the researchers said. Plasma TVs \"Older TVs may be placed in unsafe places, such as on top of cabinets, or on top of other furniture that is not intended to support a TV,\" they said. In addition, the increasing popularity of plasma TVs is also thought to be a factor in the increase in cases of children being hit by TVs. \"These TVs are lighter than older TVs, making them more likely to fall off shelves,\" the researchers said. Many of the victims are children under the age of five, who usually suffer head and neck injuries. Research shows that in 2011, cases of children being hit by TVs reached 12,300 while in 1990 the figure was 5,455.

In the case registered No. 651 K/PDT/2015, the Supreme Court stated that it rejected the cassation application of PT Kallista Alam in a civil case against the Ministry of Forestry. Siti also mentioned the verdict of the panel of judges at the Balige District Court, North Sumatra, which stated that PT Gorda Duma Sari (GDS) was proven to have violated environmental protection and management in the Tele Forest, Samosir. The Director, Jonni Sihotang, was sentenced to 4.6 years and a fine of Rp5 billion. Based on data from the Presidential Working Unit for Development Supervision and Control (UKP4) under the administration of former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the investigation into 12 companies suspected of burning forests in the period 2012-2014 stopped immediately when their status became suspects. Records show that only three companies were punished between 2014 and 2015. Minister of Forestry and Environment Siti Nurbaya admitted that coordination was the cause of the government's slow response. 'Weak' Coordination When asked why the forest fires were not anticipated early on by President Joko Widodo's administration considering that they occur every year, Siti referred to coordination. \"Although we anticipated them from the start, the actual command came from the governors. This is ultimately related to awareness.\" \"I realize that we should have encouraged the governors to be more aware and anticipatory, but it is not easy. So when the last position when the situation was getting more difficult, I intensively contacted the governors. So there was a slight coordination problem,\" she said. The provinces of Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, West Kalimantan, South Kalimantan, and Central Kalimantan are some of the provinces worst hit by forest fires. According to the National Disaster Management Agency, the smoke from the forest fires has affected at least 200,000 people."}
