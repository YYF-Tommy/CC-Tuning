Manmohan Singh said that cross-border forces were involved in the Mumbai bomb blasts, otherwise such a systematic and large-scale destruction in the city would not have been possible. The Prime Minister added that we have strong evidence of the involvement of these forces. ‘They are out to destroy the economy of our country and destroy communal harmony, which we will not allow.’ The Indian Prime Minister warned in strong words that he would take strict action against anti-national elements who are destroying the peace of the country. The Prime Minister said that the Pakistani government had promised in 2004 that it would not allow its borders to become a hub for the activities of terrorist organizations, so the Pakistani government should fulfill its promise. Manmohan Singh said about intelligence that the police and intelligence agencies had information that terrorist organizations would try to spread terror in the city but did not know how. Talking about the investigation of the blasts, the Prime Minister said that the police and investigation agencies are working in the right direction but have not yet reached any final conclusion, so it is not appropriate for them to name any organization in advance. The Prime Minister praised the citizens of Mumbai for helping each other on such an occasion and not giving any chance to external elements to destroy the peace and order of the country. Manmohan Singh said that the country will be equipped with modern technology to deal with terrorism and the Central and State governments will work together on this.

It should be noted that Ronaldo, who leads the Portugal team in Brazil, is often in the news, but since last Sunday, he has been the center of discussion on social media for his new hairstyle, rather than his game. He has shaved the hair on the right side of his head in a Z-shape. When he appeared in public with his new hairstyle a few hours before the match against the United States, people on Twitter started scratching their heads. Someone said it should be considered one of the worst hairstyles of the World Cup, while others were wondering if it was a new way to write the number seven (7), like Ghanaian player Asamoah John has dyed three (3) in his hair. Many interpreted it as a wizard's mark. Someone wrote: 'What happened to Ronaldo's hair, isn't it sponsored by Harry Potter or something else?' But soon the mockery of his hair, especially by American citizens, suddenly changed and the rumor market heated up on Twitter. It seems that a tweet from a football fan who has almost 900 followers achieved this feat. He wrote: ‘Ronaldo cut his hair this way because he wanted to resemble the mark of a young fan who had a brain tumor and had it removed last week.’ The tweet has been shared more than 11,000 times and reposted word for word by many people from their accounts. In total, there have been more than 50,000 tweets and retweets about it. Nick Barrett from Florida, while posting his photo on the Internet, said that if Ronaldo’s hairstyle raises awareness about the disease, then that would be great. The problem here is that there is no evidence to prove it is even a rumor and Ronaldo has not posted anything on his social media since Sunday, nor has his agent or the Portugal team given any explanation about it. However, it seems that a few months ago, Ronaldo paid for a child’s brain surgery. The child had a brain disease that caused him to have seizures. The matter was widely reported in the media and the first tweet included a picture taken from an article in the American newspaper USA Today. But whether Ronaldo's new hairstyle has anything to do with this, or with the brain tumor, or something else, no one can say. Now whether there is any truth to this rumor or not, Nick Barrett, 29, from Florida, who had brain surgery eight months ago, posted a picture of his head after the surgery and told the BBC that the ongoing discussion on the Internet has reminded him: \"When you walk with this scar, everyone looks at you. If it raises awareness among people about this disease, this hairstyle is enough.\""}

Dr. Akmal Waheed has not been traced yet. He has been missing since Thursday along with his brother Dr. Arshad Waheed and the driver. His car was found near Jinnah Bridge in Keamari area the next day. Dr. Akmal’s father says that a few hours after he went missing, an unknown person called his house and demanded a ransom of Rs 10 million, after which an FIR of his kidnapping was registered at Jackson police station. Waheedullah Khan further said that if there is any allegation against his sons, then a case should be filed in court and the allegation should be proved according to the prevailing law in the country. On this occasion, Waheedullah Khan said that his sons have never done anything illegal and they have been going to Afghanistan, Iran, Bosnia and other countries for relief work. According to him, all this has always been in the knowledge of the government and his sons have never done anything in secret from the government. He said that on June 13, in the BBC morning broadcast and on the BBC website, BBC Urdu.com, Federal Minister for Information Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said that Dr. Akmal has been arrested, which surprised the family because it was not like this and that was the reason why Dr. Akmal was performing his duties at the National Institute of Cardiology as usual. He said that all these things indicate that he has been unjustly detained by the government authorities because this has happened to many doctors before. Dr. Akmal Waheed’s house was raided by law enforcement agencies a few months ago, but he could not be arrested because he was not present at home. According to his family, even after this raid, he was continuously performing his duties at the National Institute of Cardiology. Dr. Sher Shah, General Secretary of the Pakistan Medical Association Karachi, while talking to BBC Urdu.com, said that the current situation is creating a sense of insecurity among the country’s doctors. He said that Dr. Akmal and his brother have a very good reputation and have always been useful to others. Dr. Shah said that he is sure that the two doctors have been taken into custody by a government agency, which is an illegal step. Dr. Misbah-ul-Aziz, leader of the Pakistan Islamic Medical Association, said that the doctors’ representatives have contacted government circles but have not received any encouraging response so far."}

The first match of the day has started between the two teams of Group F, Argentina and Iran. In this match, the Argentine team is expected to take the field with the formation of 3-3-4 and striker Gonzalo Higuain may be included in the team again. This will be the 100th match for Argentina midfielder Javier Mascherano for his country and he is the fourth Argentine player to achieve this honor. Argentina won its first match in the tournament against Bosnia and Herzegovina by a score of 2-1 and a victory against Iran will ensure its access to the next round. Argentina faced difficulties due to the opposing team's defensive play in the match against Bosnia and it may face a similar situation in the match against Iran. Germany is considered one of the favorites of this World Cup. Iran adopted a very defensive style in the match against Nigeria and that is why that match was goalless and it is also being called the most boring match of this World Cup so far. There is no possibility of any change in the Iranian team for the match against Argentina. In the second match of the day, the German team, which started brilliantly in Group H, will face the African country Ghana. After a brilliant four-goal victory against Portugal, Germany has become one of the favorites of this World Cup and due to the better goal difference, a victory in this match will be enough to ensure Germany's access to the next stage. The Bosnian team had troubled Argentina with its defensive play in the first match. The participation of German defender Mats Hummels is doubtful in this match, who injured his thigh in the match against Portugal. He will be given every opportunity to prove his fitness before the match, but whether he is fit or not, captain Philipp Lahm will play a defensive role in the midfield. Ghana's Michael Essien is available to join the team after recovering from a toe injury. Ghana must win this match to survive in the World Cup as a defeat to Germany after the USA will knock them out of the World Cup. The final match on Saturday will be between Group F teams Nigeria and Bosnia and this match is very important for Bosnia as a defeat in this will knock them out of the tournament."}

It should be remembered that earlier, the Division Bench of the Islamabad High Court had also ordered his reinstatement, but despite this, the speculations about his removal from his post have not diminished, but are increasing every day.۔It is being said that since Zaka Ashraf is not a 'man of the present government', the Prime Minister of Pakistan, who has now become the patron of the Pakistan Cricket Board through a notification, can use his constitutional powers to bring his own man to the post of chairman of the board at any time.۔The question arises: Will the Prime Minister send home the pen-wielding Zaka Ashraf? Legal experts do not think it is that easy.۔Afnan Karim Kundi, who represented Zaka Ashraf in the Islamabad High Court and then the Supreme Court, has solid arguments in this regard.۔He said that the Patrons cannot just remove the chairman, but they have to abolish the entire board, but for this, three points are necessary. First, there must be very serious financial irregularities in the cricket board.۔Second, as a result of these irregularities, the entire board has become inactive and ineffective, and third, there is clear evidence of all of these.۔According to Afnan Karim Kundi, the government has made it clear during the court proceedings that none of these three things currently exist.۔Afnan said, \"The government itself has stated in writing in court that it has no intention of interfering in the Pakistan Cricket Board and that it has not found any financial corruption in the cricket board.\"۔It is regularly audited by a chartered firm every year, so changing its stance now would be tantamount to a U-turn for the government.۔It is also worth noting that the Pakistan Cricket Board's constitution of 2013, implemented with the approval of the ICC, has eliminated government interference.۔The 2007 constitution contained a provision that the Patron, who was the President at the time, could remove the Chairman of the Cricket Board.۔Afnan Karim Kundi also raises the point that sports is now a provincial matter, which is why the Pakistan Cricket Board has been linked to the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination.۔He said that after the 18th Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan, the control of institutions that do not come under the federation is with the Council of Common Interests, therefore, any step in the matter of the cricket board without taking this council into confidence will be unconstitutional.۔These legal points are in place, but the rule of law and adherence to the constitution in Pakistan is rarely seen in sports. The biggest example of this is that despite the International Olympic Committee's threat to suspend Pakistan's membership in the Pakistan Olympic Association over government interference, this government interference has not ended.۔The election of Akhtar Rasool, a member of the ruling party, as the president of the Pakistan Hockey Federation is another example in this regard, whose election was rejected by a large number of former Olympians as a joke.۔There are also examples of NADRA and PEMRA chairmen being sent home, who approached the court and were reinstated but still could not work in their positions.۔At a time when the Pakistan Cricket Board is trying to reach a final decision on the issue of three-nation rule over the ICC, any change will further affect Pakistan's already lost prestige in the ICC.۔It should be remembered that Zaka Ashraf has repeatedly expressed his desire to meet with the Prime Minister on this sensitive issue, but he could not find time due to other important engagements of the Prime Minister.۔This situation should not allow the Prime Minister to find time to sign the papers to change the chairman, because anything can happen in the Pakistan Cricket Board, which is connected to Pakistani politics.۔"}

On the occasion of the burial, more than six thousand people came to Putokari where the coffins covered with green cloth were kept in a big hall. Among the visitors to the cemetery were relatives and friends of the buried, as well as ordinary Bosnian citizens. Srebrenica was declared a safe area by the United Nations during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Coffins covered with green cloth were placed in a large hall.Between July 6 and 8, 1995, Bosnian Serb forces besieged the safe zone of Srebrenica to avoid an attack by Serb forces in northeastern Bosnia. Therefore, thousands of Bosnian citizens took shelter. Thousands of innocent civilians were being protected by around 600 Dutch infantry troops, but the Bosnian Serb army wrested control of the area from this UN force consisting of lightly armed Dutch soldiers. After taking control of Srebrenica, Bosnian Serb troops killed more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys. This massacre is also said to be the largest incident of violence in Europe since World War II. The Srebrenica massacre has been declared genocide by the International Criminal Court and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and the former head of the Bosnian Serb army, Radovan Karadzic, and his top commander, Radko Mladic, have been indicted for war crimes and genocide.

CDA has decided to take the help of the police to eradicate these twelve slums and the agency says that these settlements are not only illegal, but also harbor criminals. Traffic is normal. More than 1,000 people living in such settlements protested against the CDA in Islamabad on Friday. Pastor Yusuf Masih Bhatti, a leader of the Christian community, said that most of these communities are inhabited by Christians, and if this action takes place, where will they go? He said that Chaudhry Nisar has given orders and has made many accusations against us that we work in the morning and commit robberies at night. I met CDA official Shaista Sohail and asked her to give us the list of these criminals if so. If there are any Taliban in these settlements, we are ready to leave,” said CDA official Shaista Sohail. Twelve settlements are being processed, they are illegal and their population has increased in the last few years.

It has been given, but the Afghan settlement is very old. Why is it being demolished?' Shaista Sohail believes that the reason for the proliferation of these settlements is the lack of CDA: 'I have been trying for a year and a half to have regular operations.

Its foundation is thirteen hundred years old, when our Prophet, even after conquering the Jews and Christians, had treated them well not only in words but also in practice.\"۔\"He treated them with the utmost kindness and showed respect for their religion and beliefs.\"۔Wherever Muslims ruled, they followed the same compassionate and noble principle of respecting other religions and beliefs, and we should follow the same path.۔The second speech is from June 3, 1947, which was broadcast on All India Radio in Delhi.۔Two months later, Jinnah left for Pakistan.۔The speech was about the proposed transfer of power from the British imperial government to the Indian people, in which Jinnah repeatedly emphasizes the need to maintain peace.۔Earlier, All India Radio had refused to broadcast these speeches.۔His position was that they could affect relations with Pakistan.۔The then Director General of PBC, Murtaza Solangi, had contacted Prasar Bharati officials in March last year to obtain a copy of this speech, but Prasar Bharati said that it did not even have the recording of this speech.۔When this news broke in Indian newspapers, civil rights activist Subhash Chandra Agarwal asked Prasar Bharati under the Right to Information Act to provide details of the speeches of all the leaders who had migrated to Pakistan after partition.۔Mr. Agarwal appealed to the Chief Information Commission, which rejected Prasar Bharati's argument, saying that more than 60 years have passed and there is no longer any justification for not releasing the speeches.۔Agarwal says he essentially wanted to prove that the current Pakistan is not what Jinnah wanted to create and that \"abuses against minorities are common there today.\"۔Muhammad Ali Jinnah, while addressing the meeting of the Constituent Assembly on August 11, 1947, said that in the newly formed Pakistan, the rights of minorities should be protected in every way, they should have the freedom to go to their temples and mosques and the state should have nothing to do with their religious beliefs.۔"}

Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, who said that “the war against the Jewish state will continue,” hinted that more Israelis would be kidnapped to free more Lebanese prisoners. Israeli politicians were already expressing this fear and opposing the deal. The freed prisoners were brought to Lebanon from Germany on an Airbus. The deal between Israel and Lebanon was brokered by Germany. The deal was reached after years of negotiations. BBC analyst Roger Hardy said that Israel is always ready to release its citizens, but it has to pay a heavy price for it. He said that many Arabs believe that Hezbollah forced Israel out of southern Lebanon four years ago.

The price of petrol is expected to be reduced by five rupees from February 1.

Four crew members were killed in the crash. A spokesman for the European planemaker told the BBC that the company's engineers had discovered irregularities in the plane's data logs that could be linked to the crash. Airbus has also sent a warning message to the air forces of other countries that have purchased the planes. They say they should check the electronic control units (ECUs). \"They are essentially computers and are part of every engine,\" the spokesman said. \"The ECU's job is to control the engine to carry out the actions the pilot is telling it to do, following instructions from the pilot.\" \"You can conclude that as we have asked for the ECU to be re-checked, that is our focus.\" The spokesman added that the nature of the fault has emerged after the company's investigators received information from Airbus's flight operations team and collected logs obtained during the ground test of flight MSN 23. According to Reuters, the fault was caused by the software installed in the aircraft rather than the design. Other such aircraft have been grounded since the A400M crash. The A400M aircraft were designed to deliver troops and weapons to Europe's NATO partners. According to a contract in 2013, they were worth $2.3 billion. However, European foreign ministers gave Airbus more funds due to delays and price changes. The first such aircraft was delivered to France in August 2014. But the latest crash means that the countries that bought the aircraft - Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey - will face further delays in the delivery of the planes. A spokesman for the UK Ministry of Defence said: \"The Royal Air Force will not use its A400M Atlas aircraft until further details of the A400M crash are known.\" In addition to Airbus' investigation into the crash, Spanish defence officials are also investigating the crash, but they could not provide further details. Captain Miguel González Molina said: \"The court has ruled on the confidentiality of the judicial investigation. Therefore, the (Spanish) Ministry of Defence will not make any comments that could prejudice the investigation.\""}

Iran has not given any guarantee regarding halting its nuclear program to which representatives of these countries have given Tehran two weeks to respond. This is the first direct dialogue between Iran and the United States in the negotiations on Iran's nuclear conflict. In these negotiations in Geneva, the United States was represented by William Burns, a senior American official, but he did not express his opinion in this regard. However, in this regard, the spokesperson of the State Department, San McCormick, issued a statement from Washington in strong words. He said, \"I hope that the Iranian people will understand that their leaders have to choose a path between cooperation and conflict. Nothing else'. Mr McCormick added that Mr Burns had sent a \"clear and simple message\" that Washington was serious about the aid package but that talks would only be possible if Iran stopped its actions. Diplomats hope that Iran will accept some conditions from the West on curbing its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of new sanctions on Tehran. \"We hope that we will get an encouraging response and we hope that it will happen in two weeks,\" he said. Mr. Solana said he had agreed to meet Iran's top negotiator, Saeed Jalili, again in the next two weeks by telephone or face-to-face. The BBC's John Laney in Tehran says Iran is interested in the offer, but it is not clear whether leaders are at odds over it or whether Iran wants to hold off for a while. Saeed Jalili, Iran's top negotiator, says that he has presented a lot of positive ideas and called on the Western powers not to back down from the talks. But Iran's seriousness for the success of these talks was doubted when a member of the Iranian delegation said that stopping uranium enrichment for Iran's nuclear program was \"out of the question\". Iran maintains that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and that it has no intention of acquiring nuclear weapons. But Iran is not ready to stop enriching uranium, which is against the demand of the United Nations Security Council."}

Homes are being destroyed, what kind of freedom is this? Revolution revolution۔' Read more news about the extrajudicial killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud and Naqeebullah's 'death in a police encounter' Spontaneous notice 'I wish Naqeebullah's name was Ehsanullah Ehsan' 'Army and civilian institutions should help in the arrest of Rao Anwar' However, fortunately, this protest or revolution has been peaceful so far۔A tribal youth participating in the protest proudly said that in all this protest, even a pot has been broken? 'We are a people seeking peace۔We are being misrepresented.۔Traditional Waziristan turbans and warm hats are seen in abundance at the rally, and the Mehsud tribesmen's love for long hair is also evident here.۔The alleged extrajudicial killing of 27-year-old Naqeebullah Mehsud, a young man from South Waziristan, by police in Karachi on January 13 has prompted the largest and most powerful protest in the history of the tribes.۔By the way, there is a lot of activity in the meeting place all day long, but the real excitement is seen after the Maghrib prayer.۔When a tribesman from Wana, the capital of North Waziristan, was asked why he had come, he said that he had brought a patient to Islamabad for treatment, but he makes sure to attend the protest every evening.۔\"This is our problem and we want to bring it to the media,\" he said.۔However, some people are asking the same question: What is the reason behind this? Who is behind this protest? Who is financially supporting them? With these questions, I reached out to tribal journalist Gohar Mehsud, who explained in detail that even before the death of Naqeebullah (whose real name was Naseem Mehsud), the tribesmen were filled with grief and anger over the daily casualties caused by landmines.۔'Photos of two children who were victims of landmines on social media have shaken people's consciences'۔On February 2, there was talk of a sit-in in Islamabad in this regard when the story of Naqeebullah's kidnapping came to light.۔The youths have already started saying that Naqeeb's body will be found and the media will broadcast the news given by the police that another terrorist has been killed.۔'Unfortunately, something like this happened.۔The story took the same turn as the concerns.۔Social media was already on fire, and according to tribal journalists, the tweet by PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari made it a national media outlet, which eventually started covering it.۔When the protest rally seeking justice from Waziristan reached Islamabad, relatives of many other extrajudicially murdered people also joined it.۔Among them, the father and brother of Tariq, who was killed in an alleged police encounter in Dera Ghazi Khan, were also seen holding banners demanding justice.۔When asked about the details of the incident from his elder brother Abdul Majeed, he said that his younger brother, who was also the father of a six-month-old daughter, was allegedly killed by the police in a fake encounter at the behest of a herdsman.۔\"Instead of our help, the police made the case against us that they were taking the accused to recover the stolen goods, but on the way, his brothers and uncle attacked him and killed him.۔This is a complete lie.۔We were at our homes.۔'When asked how it feels to be here and is there any hope of getting justice when everyone is talking about Naqeeb? Abdul Majeed said no, they are also talking about him and he is hopeful that he will also get justice.۔Who is behind this tribal protest? Did the social media activities of a few youths become a movement or is there some other reason? State institutions are also trying to find out.۔Tribal journalist Gohar Mehsud says the Lashkar tradition is very strong in the tribal areas.۔\"When someone is in trouble, everyone comes together.\"۔Naqeeb was from a very poor family.۔What happened to him everyone assumed had happened to his son۔Former bureaucrats, military personnel, senior journalists and politicians all came together.۔‘Money is also needed to organize such a big protest, so where is it coming from? Government agencies suspect that some international NGOs or political parties are not giving money for it? However, Gohar Mehsud denies this.۔'The Mehsud business community in Karachi is quite wealthy'۔A few of them are billionaires۔They have all given up to thirty million.۔Even as far as Islamabad, ordinary citizens have started helping the tribesmen on their own.۔According to a message on Facebook, warm blankets have been distributed to protesters during this cold season.۔There is no flag of any political party in the sit-in to keep the protest apolitical, but politicians never miss such an opportunity and come to give speeches every day, but along with expressing sympathy, they also promote their own agenda.۔Jamaat-e-Islami Ameer Senator Sirajul Haque also gave a similar speech and highlighted the role of tribals in Kashmir, but in the changing circumstances, the tribals of Pakistan do not want to be used anymore.۔State institutions and the tribes themselves fear that their protest might be hijacked.۔The organizers are being very careful in this regard and are paying attention not only to who should be allowed to speak and what should be said, but also to which slogans should be raised and which should not.۔The government has assured the arrest of former SSP Anwar Rao as soon as possible, but it seems that the protests may not end without the intervention of the army due to the weak response of the political governments and the delay in the arrest of Rao Anwar.۔"}

Rahim who wrote Bhutto's party manifesto (which was never implemented).۔In a rigidly traditional Pakistani society, Bhutto successfully sold the slogan of socialism, even Islamic, to the people with the attractive slogan of 'bread, cloth and house'.۔It was the fusion of Sindhi heritage and Marxism that brought Pakistani politics for the first time out of the Chaudhry's camp and the Vedera's quarters, the Khan's and Mullah's chambers, and into Bhati Chowk, Liaquat Park, and Kukri Ground.۔These were the days when Bhutto's feudal lords and wide friends would leave their hotels and houses for fear of Ayub Khan.۔But people like Qazi Faiz Muhammad, Imdad Muhammad Shah and the Talpur brothers became his hosts.۔Sheikh Rasheed, Dr. Mubashir Hassan, Khurshid Hassan Mir, Meraj Muhammad Khan, Ghulam Mustafa Khar, Malik Meraj Khalid, Hayat Muhammad Khan Sherpao, Talpur brothers, Mumtaz Bhutto, Abdul Hafeez Pirzada, actor Tariq Aziz, Makhdoom Talib-ul-Mawla, Hanif Ramey, Mian Mahmood Ali Kasuri were the first people to board the train of Bhutto's PPP, most of whom also attended its founding meeting.۔Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto, probably Mian Iftikharuddin and GM Syed had also founded the People's Party in the 1950s in the name of this Bhutto party.۔\"A leader emerged from Larkana. Haideri, armed with weapons, is a man-made mujahid, standing on a lion with a sword like this.\" Ali Gul Mehar, a local folk artist from Mirpur Mathelo, had said these words in those days.۔But in Bhutto's new party, the slogans of people like Meraj Muhammad Khan and Tariq Uzair were 'elections, not revolution' or 'slips, not spears', which caused quite a stir in Bhutto's presence at the famous Hala convention of the Pakistan People's Party.۔Bhutto listened to the speeches of these enthusiastic speakers and in his own speech responded, \"I met your father, Mao Zedong, in China.\"۔You people don't know how powerful America is. It is watching the guerrilla fighting in Balochistan through satellites.۔In the same Hala Convention, the youth objected to the joining of the landowners and landlords in the PPP, who were joining the PPP in droves in those days with announcements like \"Thok Ke Bhau along with his thousands of comrades, tribe and cattle, pigs and chickens!\"۔Bhutto's speeches and slogans such as 'Women of landlords in Nawabshah and Moro will also pick cotton with farmers' women' or 'My minister will sweep the streets of Lyari when he comes to power' or 'Milne Mazdoori ki zamin ki kisan ki' made the party extremely popular among the people of Pakistan۔Despite the propaganda of the mullahs and the fatwas of blasphemy against them, saying that 'socialism means sister's marriage to brother'۔Hearing the name of PPP, 'someone burnt, someone prayed'۔Some called it a 'plot permit party', while others called it a 'drink and plow party'.۔In the 1970 elections, the PPP emerged as the largest party in West Pakistan.۔But since the 1970 elections till today, the PPP (despite its great struggle against Zia-ul-Haq's eleven-year dictatorship) has been busy conspiring with military generals to seize power under the shadow of the so-called sword of accountability.۔"}

After the closure of Naya Dur, a new website named Naya Dur.tv has been launched. Although the PTA is already taking strict action against those who incite blasphemy and sectarianism and taking steps to block such websites and content, now the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) is also closing websites run by journalists.۔Censorship: 'Don't touch sensitive topics' Attempts to suppress voice in Pakistani universities too? If 'journalists forced to self-censor' don't go too far, the satirical website Khabaristan Times was also blocked in January 2017.۔Shabbir Rakhshani, along with a few friends, had been running a website called 'Hal Ahwal' for the past three years.۔In an interview with the BBC, he said that the website's aim was to discuss social, cultural and health issues in Balochistan.۔Shabbir said that it also encouraged young writers, but it was banned on May 14 without any warning.۔In your opinion, what content was published that led to your website being shut down? The answer was that we did not try to touch on such issues and include content that would harm the state and raise questions about state institutions.۔\"We have never taken up topics like missing persons۔Apart from Jalila Hydari, the news of his camp was also broadcasted in many media۔We ran that news, but we never tried to raise such issues.۔\"Probably the reason for the blocking of the new period is the articles that were not being printed by various newspapers of the country, especially regarding the Pashtun Protection Movement: Reza Rumi, a well-known American-based columnist, Reza Rumi, along with his six colleagues, have been on for the past three months. Line was running the website 'Naya Dur' which was shut down earlier this month۔According to Raza Rumi, 'New Era' is a platform for social change in which we promote video and citizen journalism.۔He says, \"When the website was blocked, we tried to find out who ordered it, but we were unsuccessful, but when we requested it again, it was partially restored.\"۔What are the reasons in your opinion? He says, “The reason for its blocking is probably the articles that were not being printed in various newspapers in the country and we did print them, especially regarding the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement.”۔\"They say we were not given any warning, which is not good.\"۔Journalist Taha Siddiqui launched a website called ‘Safe Newsrooms’ on May 3rd, World Press Freedom Day, but it was blocked within 14 days.۔\"The idea was to discuss the kind of censorship that journalists face in the newsroom in Pakistan and South Asia,\" he says.۔I used to talk to various journalists inside Pakistan.۔۔۔Yesterday I spoke to the Express Tribune journalist who told me how the ISPR controls things۔After websites are blocked, alternative methods such as VPNs or Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are being resorted to.۔On the other hand, the tweet by Pakistan Media Watch seen on social media certainly gives an indication of what criteria are being taken into account in the PTA's list of censorship and closure of channels or websites.۔Taha Siddiqui says, \"Pakistani authorities don't understand that if something is banned, it doesn't mean that people stop going to that thing. On the contrary, people become more curious and say, 'I'm seeing what's happening to me.'\"۔I think that this has happened on the orders of the Pakistani army and in a way the Pakistani army has given me publicity by imposing this ban.۔Journalist Talat Hussain retweeted this tweet with the words that it is no exaggeration that anchors of Geo News, Dunya TV and Express News have been prevented from inviting some PML-N leaders on their shows. PTA’s stance on the recent steps taken to block journalists’ websites, according to an explanation given to the BBC by a PTA spokesperson, “Any content on any website that is against the provisions of the Prevention of Electronic Media Act 2016 and if any of our relevant institutions or stakeholders have complained about any content that is present on the websites and they inform us about it, they are blocked.”۔To do this, we ask the complaining organization or stakeholder what content was objectionable and why they want it blocked.۔In response to another question, the spokesperson said that there is a detailed process to block any website in which 30 different stakeholders and related institutions register their complaints with the PTA and after reviewing them, a decision is taken to block them. And if there is a situation in which the relevant content cannot be blocked due to any technical reasons, then after talking to the supervisor of that website, the entire website is blocked.۔So can these blocked websites be reopened? The PTA replied that, \"Our rules include a procedure for reopening these websites, in which the relevant website whose content has been blocked can file a complaint with the PTA.\"۔After they are given a full hearing, a decision will be made on whether to keep the material closed or open it.۔‘"}

Speaking to BBC Urdu's Mahpara Safdar, the President's spokesperson said that it is very clear that he will hand over the duties of the Army Chief to General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani before taking the oath of office. According to Rashid Qureshi, the President will take oath at the President's House on Thursday at 11 am. Earlier, the Supreme Court, which took oath under the interim constitutional order, had also asked the President to take off his uniform before December 1. The court had also rejected several constitutional petitions against the approval of his nomination papers. General Musharraf has also described his military uniform as his 'skin' in an interview with BBC.

Constitutional pleas about eligibility were rejected. Six judges against three had declared the petitions inadmissible. Justice Fulk Sher, who was part of the bench, wrote a dissenting note in which it was said that General Pervez Musharraf cannot participate in the presidential election because he is a government employee. After that Justice retired Vijayauddin Ahmed and People's Party's Makhdoom Amin Fahim challenged the approval of the President's nomination papers.

He was promoted and appointed as the chief of the army by the then prime minister Nawaz Sharif on October 7, 1998.

It should be noted that several people were killed and thousands were injured in protests against it in May 2013. The demonstrations that began against urban development later turned into a manifestation of widespread anger against Erdogan’s government. Erdogan was the country’s prime minister at the time. The excessive use of force by riot police had increased tensions. In 2013, there were large-scale protests against the construction and expansion. According to the AFP news agency, he said during a speech in Istanbul: \"If we want to save our history, we need to rebuild this historic building and we will rebuild it.\" He was referring to the Ottoman-era barracks that are located in Gazi Park. For some Turks, the proposed construction of the barracks has symbolic significance. Some traditions say that this is where Islamist soldiers launched a failed coup in 1909.

According to the Press Trust of India news agency, Mamata Banerjee's party has won at least 200 of the 292 seats currently.۔According to the latest count, the BJP has finally won less than 100 seats.۔Also read: 'Modi is the god of Hindus, how can he be defeated' Whose name was not acceptable How did 'that woman' become the Chief Minister of West Bengal? Owaisi's rally ended with prayers and Yogi's with slogans of Jai Shri Ram: Bengal elections and Hindu-Muslim identity Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh, who belongs to the BJP, has also congratulated Mamata Banerjee on her victory۔In a tweet, he said that he congratulated Mamata Banerjee on the success of her party in West Bengal, and also expressed his best wishes for her next term.۔Why was the contest so important? In the 2019 parliamentary elections, Mamata Banerjee's TMC won 22 of the state's 42 seats, while the BJP won 18.۔In the previous parliamentary elections of 2014, this number was 34 for the TMC and 2 for the BJP. This means that the TMC suffered a heavy loss in the 2019 parliamentary elections, but still had the majority of seats.۔Therefore, the BJP, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, believed that they would win the state elections this time as well.۔Narendra Modi, former BJP president and current Home Minister Amit Shah and several senior party leaders held election rallies in West Bengal and made loud claims of their party's victory.۔The Bharatiya Janata Party was hoping to win at least 200 seats, but despite all its election machinery, this has not happened.۔In this regard, Sohail Haleem, Assistant Editor of BBC Worklife India based in New Delhi, while talking to BBC Urdu, said that it is a big deal for Mamata Banerjee that the BJP's seats have been reduced to less than 100, which has proven that despite Modi's charismatic personality, the BJP can be defeated.۔Sohail Haleem said that it remains to be seen where Mamata Banerjee's party has won and what the proportion of votes has been, but it is clear that the BJP's messages and announcements, Hindutva card, and attempts to divide the election between Hindus and Muslims have not been successful.۔He said that if the same efforts were made by the BJP in states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh or Rajasthan, the situation might have been different, but the BJP did not understand this choice.۔Sohail Haleem said that the current situation shows that local leaders have the ability to defeat Modi and especially Mamata Banerjee's popularity among women voters and her connection with the public played an important role in her victory.۔The right-wing organization and Maharashtra's ruling party Shiv Sena has called Mamata Banerjee's victory in her state a 'victory of democracy' and said that the election result will give a new face to national politics.۔It should be noted that the Shiv Sena shares power with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in Maharashtra and instead of contesting in West Bengal, it announced support for Mamata Banerjee.۔According to the Press Trust of India, Mamata Banerjee said on Sunday that fighting Covid-19 will be her government's top priority.۔In one of his messages to the party workers, he said, 'This is Bengal's victory and only Bengal can do it.۔Mamata Banerjee urges party leaders not to hold any rally to celebrate victory۔He further said that West Bengal has 'saved' India from its mandate.۔'"}

The latest example of this was seen today when the education minister of Pakistan made an important statement regarding the opening of schools for children.۔While the education system across Pakistan has been affected during the global coronavirus pandemic, the country's Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood has emerged as a hero and a villain for children.۔Also read: Educational institutions closed in Pakistan from November 26th Amina Mufti's column: Shafqat Mahmood Sahib, SOS! 'I have taken a loan of Rs 40,000 for my wife's oxygen' Pakistan's Education Minister has made it clear in his announcement regarding the resumption of classes in all educational institutions that unlike last year, this year children will not be able to go to the next grade without exams.۔After his decision to close all educational institutions on November 26, Shafqat Mehmood was being called the 'children's prime minister'.۔But now, the reaction from the students to this statement makes it seem as if the children have ousted him from this position.۔What did Shafqat Mahmood say about opening schools? In his press conference after a high-level meeting on Friday, the Education Minister announced that exams for students from class 9 to 12 will be held and educational institutions (including schools and colleges) for them will be opened from January 18.۔He said that according to the latest data, the rate of positive cases is 6.10.۔\"One thing is clear: those involved in education realize that the closure of educational institutions has harmed children's education.\"۔But health care is also important.۔He said that classes for children from first to eighth grade will begin on February 1, while educational institutions for middle and high classes will also open from February 1.۔Shafqat Mahmood said that in the future, it will be considered whether to adopt a smart lockdown approach where the infection rate is high.۔He said it is possible that educational institutions will not open where the infection rate is high.۔Shafaqat Mehmood is no longer the hero of children.

Nawaz Sharif is leaving for New Delhi on Monday on a two-day visit to attend the swearing-in ceremony of India’s newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This is the first time since the partition of the Indian subcontinent that a Pakistani prime minister will attend the swearing-in ceremony of his Indian counterpart. According to Pakistan’s state TV, the Indian prisoners were fishermen who were in jails in Hyderabad and Karachi. According to PTV, the prisoners will also have their 57 boats returned to them. Officials say 92 Indian prisoners have been released from Hyderabad and 59 from Malir Jail in Karachi. “Among those released from here are 58 fishermen and one Indian citizen who crossed the border illegally,” Karachi’s Malir Jail Deputy Superintendent Muhammad Hassan Sehto told Reuters. “In addition, 92 prisoners are being released from Hyderabad’s Nara Jail who were transferred from here to there.” After their release, these prisoners will be taken to Lahore, where Pakistani authorities will hand them over to Indian authorities at the Wagah border on Monday. India has also been releasing Pakistani fishermen in the past, and the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum, a fishermen’s organization, says that more than 200 Pakistani fishermen are currently imprisoned in Indian jails. Pakistan’s state TV says the release of these Indian prisoners has been done under the spirit of goodwill. The Pakistani Prime Minister's proposed visit to India is also being seen as a sign of improvement in relations between the two countries. The prisoners will be handed over to Indian authorities by Pakistani authorities at the Wagah border on Monday. According to observers, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's invitation to attend the swearing-in ceremony by Narendra Modi is of particular significance because Modi has been tough on Pakistan and has repeatedly criticized Pakistan. Comprehensive talks to improve relations between Pakistan and India have been stalled since the Mumbai attacks in 2008. Nawaz Sharif had hinted at improving relations with India soon after coming to power, and some time ago, the Prime Minister's Advisor on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz had said during his visit to India that he was ready to work with Narendra Modi. He had said that any progress could be made only after the formation of a new government in India and the start of comprehensive talks between the two countries. Pakistan's Information Minister Pervez Rashid also told reporters in Lahore on Saturday that Pakistan and India will have to forget the bitterness of the past for the betterment of the coming generations. He said that the BJP will have to shape India's policies for the next five years and \"the future cannot be lived with the pain of the past.\" According to Pervez Rashid, both countries will have to lay a good foundation for a good future."}

These films had neither the so-called star power nor the Bollywood masala formula, but despite this, these films entertained the audience and also earned a lot at the box office. This has the effect that these days, from the subject of the stories to the way they are presented in Bollywood films, there has also been a change. Even today, films are being made with a particular actor as the center, but now the number of films in which the story and characters get the central status has increased. The film ‘Tanu Weds Manu’, released in 2011, presented Kangana Ranaut as a strong actress in front of the audience. Films like Tanu Weds Manu have had an impact on Bollywood films these days, from the subject matter to the way they are presented. When the BBC spoke to Himanshu Sharma, who wrote the script for this film, about this change in Bollywood, he said: \"Yes, there has been a change. Ten years ago, films like 'Queen' and 'Piku' could not have been imagined.\" Regarding films based on different and new themes, Himanshu says: \"Now a large number of viewers also like the new style. I consider this era to be a good time.\" Himanshu holds the changing thinking of viewers and filmmakers responsible for this change, who want to make films outside of tradition these days. Research and discussion Zeeshan Qadri, the scriptwriter and actor of the film 'Gangs of Wasseypur', also acknowledges the change. Directors like Anurag Kashyap do a lot of research work for their films. Zeeshan Qadri says, “The change was already there, but now more such films are being made. Now, instead of stories with heroism, stories with characters are coming.” He gave the example of directors Anurag Kashyap and Tigmanshu Dhulia and said, “Such people want to portray reality on screen, that is why they do more research on each of their scripts.” Regarding the challenges of film scriptwriters, Himanshu said: “Concept writing is the biggest pressure. Many scriptwriters have to go through this.” Himanshu believes that not working according to their wishes often affects the thinking and content of scriptwriters."}

Opium serves as the raw material for the production of heroin and other illegal drugs, and is smuggled from Afghanistan and sold in various parts of the world, including the UK.۔Inspired by the ideas of agricultural experts from the US and the UK, Hamidullah, like many other farmers in Helmand, planted cotton last year, but due to the lack of a market for cotton, he has again planted opium in his fields this year.۔He said, \"The price of cotton is very low and it does not even cover the cost of the crop.\"۔They had to sell their cotton crop at a loss to feed their families.۔They believe opium cultivation is ten times more profitable.۔Afghan farmer Hamidullah says opium cultivation is ten times more profitable.

He said that the incident took place around 3:30 pm and when the FC and other security personnel reached the spot, there was nothing there except two burnt bodies, the body of the vehicle and a passport.

Imbalance in supply and demand, hoarding, overselling and complete failure of relevant government agencies to control the situation are the main reasons for the increase in prices of essential commodities in Pakistan, which sometimes lead to a 100 percent or even more increase in prices with the arrival of Ramadan.۔In this report, the BBC has examined the arrival of Ramadan in Pakistan and the UK, the increase or decrease in prices in this regard, and the factors driving it.۔Inflation and government patronage Government agencies determine the prices of food and beverages on a daily basis and this is called the government rate.۔Take the example of the federal capital, where three different lists or price lists of fruits and vegetables are issued daily.۔One price list is for citizens who go to the vegetable and fruit market to buy, the second is for the general residential sectors of Islamabad, while the third is for areas of the city where wealthy people live.۔Also read: Expenses are rising, not salaries۔۔۔How much burden does the ailing economy have on the people of Pakistan? Committee formed to determine the moon of Ramadan and Eid You will be lucky if a shopkeeper sells you fruits or vegetables at the price listed in the official price list.۔Leaving aside reasons such as hoarding and overselling, if we look at the official prices of fruits and vegetables six days before the arrival of Ramadan and on the first day of fasting, it is clear that these prices have already increased by nine to fifty percent at the official level.۔There are still 29 days left.۔According to price lists obtained from the district administration, the official selling price of the freshest potato was Rs 18 per kilogram on May 1, which is Rs 24 on the first day of fasting (May 7), meaning the price of the most basic vegetable has increased by about 33 percent.۔Similarly, the official selling price of low-quality apples was Rs 145 on May 1, which has increased to Rs 180 within six days, an increase of about 25 percent.۔Similarly, the price of tomatoes has increased by 18 percent, garlic by 50 percent, onions by nine percent, bananas by 17 percent, and guavas by eight percent.۔Saleem Khan, a fruit vendor in the vegetable market, says that from today (the first of Ramadan), the price of fruits will increase on a morning and evening basis, and according to him, this is not the fault of the vendor, the retailer or the government, but rather there is an increase in demand for fruits while the supply is almost the same.۔\"The issue of overselling was about the official price, the real problem starts after that, which is the inability to get food and drink items at their official selling price.\"۔Talking about a well-known store in the city adjacent to the vegetable market, potatoes are available here for Rs 49 per kg instead of the official rate of Rs 24, while bananas are available for Rs 179 to Rs 225 per dozen, while their official rate is Rs 140.۔Similarly, tomatoes are available at Rs 119 (official rate Rs 66), lemons at Rs 499 per kg (official rate Rs 340), apples at Rs 290 to Rs 360 (official rate Rs 180).۔Similarly, the prices of other vegetables and fruits are also much higher than the official rates۔According to the store manager, today's officially set selling price is even lower than the store owners' purchase price.۔\"We are being asked to sell a 10-kilogram packet of flour for Rs. 720. On the other hand, the purchase price from any flour mill in Islamabad is no less than Rs. 740.\"۔How can you buy at 740 and sell at 720?۔He said that if the authorities provide us with food and beverages at the rate they have specified, we can sell them at that price, otherwise there will be a loss.۔Who is responsible? Former Finance Secretary Waqar Masood says that for the past several years, people have been afraid that prices will increase during Ramadan, due to which they buy two things instead of one, which creates additional demand for goods.۔\"Increase in demand leads to a disruption in supply and demand, which makes things more expensive.\"۔On the other hand, there is no ombudsman who can catch every big seller.۔He said that it is very difficult for the government to keep an eye on every vegetable and fruit seller.۔He said that there are a few measures that can be taken to control this situation to some extent.۔\"The public should adopt simplicity and not increase demand unnecessarily, while the government has the responsibility to create as many cheap markets as possible where it can implement the prices it sets.\"۔The situation in the UK is similar to every year across the UK, with the arrival of Ramadan, all the major grocery stores, whose network is spread across the length and breadth of the country, offer many items at discounted prices for the country's five percent Muslim minority.۔Not only this, as soon as the Ramadan moon is announced, Ramadan Mubarak posters are also displayed inside stores including Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons, and special shelves are set aside on which items sold at discounted prices during Ramadan are carefully displayed.۔These stores take special care of the needs of Muslims by announcing Ramadan packages۔Food items, including dates, gram flour, rice, and various types of juices and halal beverages, are prominently displayed among the items priced at discounted prices.۔Their prices are either lower than normal or they are provided to customers under a 'buy one get one free' offer.۔According to the last census in the UK in 2011, Muslims make up just five percent of the total population of the UK.۔Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Asda offer different 'deals' despite low percentage of Muslims in the total population۔Looking at these stores, it feels like they are trying to outdo each other.۔It seems like all the stores are trying to outdo each other to make more Muslims their regular customers.۔In areas of London where the number of Muslims is slightly higher, even non-Muslims in these stores know that the Muslim fasting month is underway.۔Apart from London, the feeling of Ramadan is felt even more intensely in Birmingham, Kent, Leicester, Manchester and Bradford, where Muslims, especially Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and other countries, live in large numbers.۔Muslim shops can be found in almost every market in these areas.۔These Muslim shops cannot compete with big stores in the race to reduce prices.۔The economic principle of 'economy of scale' seems to be at work here.۔"}

He put the ball in the selection committee’s court and said that if the selectors select him, he will definitely play. However, he also made it clear that the selectors have been clearly instructed to keep in mind the 100 percent physical fitness of the player at the time of selection. He said that the twenty players who got the central contract have been selected from the thirty-three names presented by the selection committee. He said that Inzamam-ul-Haq was not among these thirty-three players. The Pakistan Cricket Board chairman also said that the twenty cricketers who have been given central contracts are available for selection in both formats of cricket, i.e. One-day and Test cricket. He was referring to Inzamam-ul-Haq, who has said goodbye to one-day cricket after the World Cup. The decision not to give a central contract to Inzamam-ul-Haq is not unexpected because the entire responsibility for the disappointing performance of the Pakistani team in the World Cup was placed on Inzamam-ul-Haq, calling him a leader and dictator. When the Pakistan Cricket Board decided to hold national camps in three phases to prepare for the upcoming cricket season, the message was sent that his future had been decided by not including Inzamam-ul-Haq in the first two camps. Immediately after the World Cup, the Pakistan Cricket Board suspended the central contracts of the players and these contracts have been given for a short period of six months. The Pakistan Cricket Board chairman said that central contracts are being given to players based on the performance of the players in the current ICC rankings, but while giving a new central contract in January next year, the Pakistan Cricket Board will base the formula of performance, seniority, fitness and discipline. The seven players in the B category include Salman Butt, Mohammad Sami, Imran Farhat, Mohammad Hafeez, Yasir Hameed, Danish Kaneria and Kamran Akmal. While Category C consists of Imran Nazir, Rao Iftikhar, Faisal Iqbal, Misbah-ul-Haq and Yasir Arafat."}

The government is claiming to have overcome the crisis and ended the shortage, while shopkeepers and the public are complaining that the crisis continues, flour is disappearing from the market and being sold at high prices.

He said that the wheat crop in Sindh will come to the market in early March and the government has fixed the support rate of wheat at Rs 350 per 40 kilograms and it is feared that the price of flour will increase from Rs 420 per 40 kilograms to Rs 470 in April.
