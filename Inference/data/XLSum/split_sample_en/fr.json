{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content in one sentence.\nAttiéké, the champagne of Côte d'Ivoire\nAttiéké is traditionally made by women in villages on the outskirts of major cities in Côte d'Ivoire. Attiéké is a traditional couscous made from cassava tubers. It is eaten by many Ivorians for breakfast, lunch or dinner. This dish has been native to the coastal areas of Côte d'Ivoire for centuries. Nowadays, it has found its way beyond the borders of Côte d'Ivoire, becoming one of the most famous foods throughout French-speaking Africa, Europe and North America. This dish can be cooked in a variety of ways. The most popular is \"attiéké poisson grillé\", made with fried fish and slices of tomato, onion and green pepper. \"Attiéké sauce tomate\", as its name suggests, is made with cooked tomato sauce and fresh or dried fish. It is very popular with Ivorians, as is \"attiéké huile rouge\". For the latter, couscous is mixed with palm oil, which turns its almond color to orange. Côte d'Ivoire deplores that people claim to make attiéké with \"only part of the process\" of making the Ivorian national dish. Attiéké can also be accompanied by a chili soup or eaten with grilled chicken or smoked fish. It is then called APF, the initials for \"attiéké poisson fumé\". Attiéké is traditionally made by village women, on the outskirts of large Ivorian cities as well, particularly in the south and center of Côte d'Ivoire. The cassava root is peeled, grated and mixed with a previously fermented cassava, called \"mangnan\". The paste is pressed to remove the starch. And then processed manually and dried, before being steamed. Attiéké is sold in local markets, in bags. Many people outside of Côte d'Ivoire, in Africa and even in Southeast Asia, claim to make attiéké, which, among other reasons, pushes the Ivorian government to want to protect the intellectual property rights on this dish. They use the name of the dish to sell food produced with \"only part of the process\" of making attiéké, denounces the spokesman of the Ivorian government, Bruno Koné. The announcement of the labeling of the dish follows a serious shortage of attiéké in Côte d'Ivoire markets this year. President Alassane Ouattara has blamed \"cartels\" for the shortage. He has asked the police to investigate and dismantle them. Attieke is made from cassava tubers. Workers' unions and consumer groups have welcomed Mr Ouattara's decision. It is a popular move in a country often divided by politics, with memories still fresh of a decade-long political crisis that left more than 3,000 people dead. The desire to trademark attiek is one of the few things that still unites Côte d'Ivoire's 20 million people, which includes 62 ethnic groups. The Ivorian government has asked the African Intellectual Property Organization (OAPI) to protect attiek. Can attiek be protected? Since OAPI does not have a compliance police unit, it is unlikely that Côte d'Ivoire's request will be met. Since African markets, in Côte d'Ivoire as elsewhere on the continent, are the place where DVDs and other musical products are sold, it is unimaginable to be able to inspect bags of attiéké and confiscate those that are not certified."}

This is according to a global model of the scale of the plastic problem over the next 20 years.Dr Costas Velis, from the University of Leeds, said the figure was \"staggering\" but that we had \"the technology and the ability to stem the tide\"..The report is published in the journal Science.\"This is the first comprehensive assessment of what the situation might be like in 20 years,\" explained Dr. Velis..Read also: Plastic bags banned in Kenya CI: Alcohol in plastic bags banned Plastic packaging ban 'could harm the environment' \"It's hard to imagine the amount of plastic that is, but if you could imagine laying all that plastic out on a flat surface, it would cover one and a half times the area of ​​the UK.It's complex [to calculate] because plastic is everywhere and in each part of the world it is different in terms of use and treatment.\".Beach plastic may be a tiny fraction of waste To turn this complex problem into numbers, researchers tracked plastic production, use and disposal around the world.The team then created a model to predict future plastic pollution.What they called a \"business as usual\" scenario - based on the current trend of increasing plastic production and no significant change in the amount of reuse and recycling - produced the 1.3 billion metric tons estimate..By adjusting their model, the researchers were able to predict how different interventions would affect this figure; they modified their model to increase recycling, reduce production, and replace plastic with other available materials..Winnie Lau, of the US-based Pew Charitable Trusts, which funded the research, told BBC News it was vital to put all possible solutions in place.\"If we do this,\" she said, \"we can reduce the amount of plastic that goes into the ocean - by 2040 - by 80%.\".Plastic pollution affects the world's seas.The measures the researchers called for included: - reducing the growth of plastic production and consumption; - replacing plastic with paper and compostable materials; - designing products and packaging for recycling; - increasing waste collection rates in middle- and low-income countries and supporting the \"informal collection\" sector; - building facilities to dispose of the 23% of plastic that cannot be recycled economically, as a transitional measure; - reducing exports of plastic waste.Read also: When old fridges make new ones How can CO2 be transformed? But even if \"all possible measures\" were taken, Dr Velis explained, the model showed that there would be an additional 710 million tonnes of plastic waste in the environment over the next two decades.There is no \"magic bullet\" for the plastic problem.But an often overlooked problem that this study highlighted is the fact that an estimated 2 billion people in the Global South lack access to proper waste management..\"They have to get rid of all their waste, so they have no choice but to burn it or throw it away,\" Dr Velis said..And while they play a major role in reducing plastic waste globally, the estimated 11 million waste pickers – people who collect and sell reusable materials in low-income countries – often lack basic employment rights and safe working conditions..Lockdown - coronavirus: he uses his time to raise awareness about plastic waste Dr Velis said: \"Waste pickers are the unsung heroes of recycling - without whom the mass of plastic entering the aquatic environment would be considerably greater\".He added that policies to support them and make their work safer were an essential part of the solution to the problem..Waste pickers often work in unsafe conditions Dr Ian Kane, from the University of Manchester, who was recently part of a team that calculated the amount of microplastic on the seabed, described the picture the researchers painted as \"horrifying\"..\"The authors are clear that there are large uncertainties in the data and analysis, but whatever the exact figures, the increasing rate of plastic production to meet growing global demand is having quite dire consequences for the environment,\" he told BBC News..Dr Velis: “Waste pickers are the unsung heroes of recycling – without whom the mass of plastic entering the aquatic environment would be considerably greater”.He added that policies to support them and make their work safer were an essential part of the solution to the problem..Dr Ian Kane, from the University of Manchester, who was recently part of a team that calculated the amount of microplastic on the seabed, described the picture the researchers painted as \"horrifying\"..\"The authors are clear that there are large uncertainties in the data and analysis, but whatever the exact figures, the increasing rate of plastic production to meet growing global demand is having quite dire consequences for the environment,\" he told BBC News..Other environmental topics: Car-free day in Addis Ababa Environment: new record for CO2 concentration Professor Jamie Woodward, also from the University of Manchester, highlighted the irony of this scenario being developed during the pandemic.“Plastic has kept many frontline workers safe during this time,” he said..\"But PPE waste could be horrendous over the next decade.\"There are parallels with the problem of climate change in that the status quo will be disastrous.We need to radically change our behavior\"."}

The small 5,000-year-old piece of wood - which has broken down into several pieces - is said to be \"extremely important\". Don't miss it on BBC Africa: Engineer Waynman Dixon originally discovered it in 1872 among artefacts inside the pyramid's Queens' Chamber. The piece of cedar - believed to have been used in the construction of the pyramid - was donated to the university in 1946, but was no longer located at the time. Assistant curator Abeer Eladany found it while examining pieces in the university's Asia collection. Abeer Eladany made the discovery Abeer, who is originally from Egypt and worked for ten years at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, cross-referenced it with other documents. 'Hidden in plain sight' \"Once I looked at the numbers in our Egypt files, I knew right away what it was, and that it had indeed been hidden in plain sight in the wrong collection,\" she said. \"I am an archaeologist and have worked on excavations in Egypt, but I never imagined that it would be here in the north-east of Scotland that I would find something so important to my own country's heritage. Read also: \"It may only be a small piece of wood, which is now in pieces, but it is hugely significant as it is one of only three objects ever found inside the Great Pyramid.\" Two other objects found by Waynman Dixon - a ball and a hook - are now in the British Museum. \"The university's collections are vast - there are hundreds of thousands of objects - so looking for this piece of wood would have been like finding a needle in a haystack,\" Ms Abeer added. \"I couldn't believe it when I realised what was inside this seemingly innocuous cigar box.\" An illustration of the pyramids by Charles Piazzi Smyth Covid restrictions have delayed the dating of the cedar fragment that was found. The results were recently published and show that the wood could date to between 3341 and 3094 BC. 'A revelation' This would support the theory that, whatever their use, the 'Dixon Relics' were the source of the construction of the Great Pyramid and not later objects left by those who explored the chambers. But the dating is also surprising because historical records have dated the pyramid itself to around 500 years later. Neil Curtis, head of museums and special collections at the University of Aberdeen, said: \"Finding the missing Dixon relic was a surprise, but the carbon dating was also a revelation. It's even older than we had thought.\" Read also: \"This could be because the date relates to the age of the wood, perhaps from the centre of an ancient tree. Or it could be because trees were rare in ancient Egypt, meaning that wood was rare, valuable and recycled or maintained over many years.\" He added: \"It will now be up to scholars to debate its use and whether it was deliberately deposited, as happened later in the New Kingdom when pharaohs tried to emphasise continuity with the past by burying themselves with antiquities. \"This discovery will certainly revive interest in Dixon's relics and how they can shed light on the Great Pyramid.\" You may also be interested in: Egypt to build a major archaeological museum to boost tourism"}

Everything turned around at the last moment, despite the poll results frantically announced by the media. Here are 4 simple factors that explain why Hillary lost the election: 1. The Latino vote On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton won 65% of the Latino electorate, a result lower than Barack Obama's support, supported by 67% of Hispanics in 2008 and 71% in 2012. However, with a Spanish vice president expected in the person of Tim Kaine, everything suggested that Clinton had this electorate in her pocket. Despite Donald Trump's talk of building the wall and deporting illegal immigrants, he still received 29 percent of the vote from Latino voters. That helped him win the key state of Florida, a slap in the face for Democrats. 2. African-American voters About 88 percent of African-American voters supported Clinton, compared to 8 percent for Donald Trump, according to figures released Wednesday. While the margin is huge, it's not as big as the 93 percent of the black vote Obama won in 2012, compared to 7 percent for Mitt Romney. Despite all Trump said about inner cities and how African-Americans live in them, these voters didn't turn out to vote for Hillary. Many of them feel that neither candidate stood up for them. 3. Young people under 30 This group represents a third of the American electorate. The exit poll showed that 54% of young voters voted for the Democrat, while 46% of them supported Donald Trump. They had supported Barack Obama by 60% four years ago. One explanation is that Bernie Sanders supporters did not come out of their homes. Many of them believed the election was rigged to the detriment of their candidate. Clinton tried to adopt many of Sanders' positions and won the support of big celebrities like Jay-Z and Lady Gaga. But it did not work. The opinion and the vote of the younger generation revolve around specific issues and ideas, not around perceptions and personalities. Sanders voters, Jill Stein voters, and all those who are angry, have lost hope in the face of an electoral process that they consider obsolete and the two-party system that they reject. 4. Trump's silent supporters A large number of voters felt that the two candidates represented neither the Democratic nor the Republican front. A majority of them stayed home and the rest went out to vote against Hillary. They are \"the forgotten man and woman,\" as Mr. Trump summed up in his speech the day after the election. The fracture in the country is significant, Hillary acknowledged, whose usual base of voters has turned against her. They want a new person, far from the usual cliché of the typical politician. An outsider to the system, running against it. That's what Donald Trump embodied. Voters did not trust Hillary after the many scandals that arose during the campaign. In his victory speech, Trump presented Hillary as a woman of the system \"looking for a third term for President Obama.\" A portion of Latino voters supported Trump, despite his harsh rhetoric targeting immigrants."}

addiction affecting millions of Egyptians.\"When I was 15, we were playing PlayStation in an arcade, and someone insulted me, I took a pool cue and smashed it on my head, I was shouting insults around and I even broke the windows.\"Now 24, Abdul Hameed recalls the moment he realised his addiction had spiralled out of control..Tramadol entered his life two years earlier, at age 13, when he tried the opioid painkiller for the first time..Like many young Egyptians, he started out taking a quarter of a 100mg tablet to get high..Abdul Hameed, 24, had been taking Tramadol since he was 13. \"I felt like a superhero,\" he says..\"I could do anything.\"Abdul Hameed was taking 57 painkillers a day, including Tramadol tablets and other opioids that he could easily find..He overdosed several times and could have died..'Sad reality' Nearly one in three Egyptians, or about 30 million people, are addicted to drugs, according to a report on addiction rates in Egypt..Tramadol is their drug of choice.It appeared on the market in Egypt 20 years ago.Cheaper than heroin and easily available on the market, it quickly became popular with drug addicts before spreading as a way to cope not only with physical pain, but also with the stresses of everyday life..Tramadol use has become so widespread in Egypt that addiction hotlines say they are receiving up to 500 calls a day from desperate people..Drug addicts are often young.The government-run drug rehabilitation centre at Cairo's Abbasiya psychiatric hospital told the BBC that more than half of its patients are aged between 21 and 30..British woman Laura Plummer sentenced to three years in prison for drug smuggling.She brought 300 Tramadol tablets to Egypt According to official statistics, most Tramadol addicts in Egypt are men, about 70%, but there are also a growing number of women.Ahlam, a young mother, started taking Tramadol to cope with daily chores and childcare.Like Abdul Hameed, she started with a quarter of a 100g tablet, but quickly progressed to four tablets a day.Today, even if she increases the dose, the medicine no longer has the same effect..\"I enjoyed the energy rush,\" she said..\"But today, the climb is no longer there.\"The addiction is obvious.She is pale and thin, smokes a lot and looks much older than her 28 years..His family is also suffering.\"My husband gave me money to buy chicken,\" she said..\"I claimed I bought some and the kids ate it all but of course it wasn't true, I used the money to buy Tramadol and gave them pasta instead, that's the sad truth.\"Ahlam sold furniture from her family home to have enough to feed her drug habit, and at one particularly dark moment she even offered sex to a neighbour, also a drug addict, in exchange for some pills..He refused.Without Prescription One of the reasons Tramadol has become so popular in Egypt is that it is so easy to obtain.By law, it can only be sold with a prescription, and pharmacists who sell it without a prescription face up to 25 years in prison..But drug addicts say the law is not being enforced..Tramadol should only be sold on prescription That was the case when I walked into a pharmacy in downtown Cairo to ask for Tramadol..I was told they had sold out, and was offered two other equally addictive painkillers instead..At no time was I asked for a prescription..Dr Yasin Rajal, the technical director of Egypt's Central Administration for Pharmaceutical Affairs, told the BBC that the health ministry recognised the dangers of painkillers and was making efforts to crack down on illegal sales..\"There are various laws in place to regulate the sale of painkillers,\" he said..\"The Ministry of Health is keeping an eye on pharmaceutical outlets in Egypt and is working alongside the Ministry of Interior to carry out inspections and spot checks..\" 'Street Market' But while authorities can prosecute pharmacies that sell Tramadol without a prescription, users have found other ways to get it.\"Doctor shopping\" has become a common practice.Drug addicts see several doctors at once, feigning a back problem or sports injury, and get multiple prescriptions for different painkillers that they use at different pharmacies..One in three Egyptians are addicted to painkillers The black market is thriving.In Giza, Egypt's third largest city, southwest of Cairo, Abdul Hameed takes me to a street where drug addicts come to buy their medication..It's just getting dark and there are so many people walking around that it looks like a street market..We hear 'Tramadol', 'hashish' and 'heroin' all the time..Many drug addicts buy a drink they call \"cockroaches\", which is based on Parkinol, a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease..Everything is happening scandalously in front of everyone.Turning the page Reformed, Abdul Hameed hopes that this universe is defensively behind him.He tries, once again, to stop everything.He has been sober for three months.He has failed eight times before, at home and in unlicensed \"treatment facilities\" where addicts are locked in a room and left alone to deal with withdrawal symptoms..Now he is in a private clinic.\"They give us different medications to treat withdrawal symptoms and gradually reduce the dosage of the addictive substances,\" he says..\"We attend meditation classes, do sports, share experiences, I feel like I'm being reborn.\"For the first time in years, he begins to look to the future with hope..\"I started private lessons to prepare myself to go back to school,\" he said..He dreams of getting married one

Led by Alfonso Dhlakama, Renamo's men decided to take up arms again in 2013 to demand a power-sharing arrangement. Since then, Mozambique has been experiencing a new period of instability.

In mid-August, an initial agreement aimed at sharing power at the regional level had been reached.

Read also: A vaccine - along with better healthcare - is seen as the best way out of the restrictions that have been imposed on all our lives. About a dozen tests are currently in the final stages - or more commonly 'phase 3' trials - but this is the first to show results. The vaccine uses a completely experimental approach - injecting part of the virus's genetic code - to activate the immune system. Previous trials have shown that the vaccine encourages the body to make two antibodies - and another part of the immune system called T cells to prevent Covid-19 infections. The first effective coronavirus vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19, preliminary results show. Two doses, three weeks apart, are required. Trials – in the US, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa and Turkey – show 90% protection is achieved seven days after the second dose. Pfizer expects to deliver 50 million doses by the end of this year and around 1.3 billion by the end of 2021.

What is Project Big Picture? EFL chairman Rick Parry has called for support for Project Big Picture The plan, drawn up by Liverpool and Manchester United, will see teams in the European Football Federation (EFL), the leagues below the Premier League, receive £250 million ($181 billion) to share among themselves, plus 25% of any revenue from future TV deals the Premier League secures.The clubs, led by EFL chairman Rick Parry, have been asking the Premier League for money for some time as they struggle financially due to the absence of fans in stadiums since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic..The idea is that by helping to fund the EFL, top-flight clubs would support the \"football pyramid\", which is at the heart not only of English football but also of the country's way of life..Not to be missed on BBC Africa: But this aid would have a price.In return, the football calendar would be reduced to feature only the top Premier League clubs - the number of Premier League teams would be reduced to 18, and the EFL Cup (currently the Carabao Cup) and Community Shield would be scrapped..The changes would free up match dates that could be replaced by higher-earning European Football Federation matches and pre-season friendlies..The Premier League's \"big six\" clubs - Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea - would also be given special voting rights on certain issues, as would West Ham, Everton and Southampton..Why now? Jay-Jay Okocha's former team Bolton Wanderers is one of the teams in deep financial trouble Why now? As with all the decisions and reforms of 2020, the answer is: Covid19.A number of EFL clubs are facing serious financial difficulties, and Rick Parry has been pushing for this rescue plan to happen for some time..Even before Covid19, several teams - Bury, Macclesfield and Jay Jay Okocha's former club Bolton - had either gone bankrupt or gone into administration in the last two years, and indeed discussions around 'Project Big Picture' had begun before the pandemic..But Covid-19 has pushed more clubs to the brink of ruin as they are not allowed to stage matches with spectators - and collect the associated revenue from gates, merchandise and refreshments - under government rules aimed at limiting the spread of the virus..Read also: Meanwhile, at the top of the pyramid, the Premier League's \"Big Six\" are far less reliant on ticket revenue, being funded primarily by multi-billion dollar TV deals with UK and international broadcasters - and, in some cases, by very wealthy owners..This is what has allowed them to continue to carry out huge transfer operations even in this period of crisis..For many months there has been talk of some sort of Premier League-funded bailout of the EFL, and what form it will take..Today, there is at least one concrete proposal.Who's against? The Football League has been around since 1888, when it was founded by William McGregor Who's against? Almost everyone.Certainly the Premier League itself - as opposed to its clubs - is very unhappy with the idea, saying: \"In the Premier League's view, a number of the proposals in this plan published today could have a detrimental impact on the whole of football and we are disappointed to see Rick Parry, the EFL chairman, give his formal support.\".It seems that clubs outside the 'big six' will not benefit from this: they will have to contribute equally to the EFL bailout, but they will play fewer games, which will have an impact on their finances..West Ham, one of those who would at least have a vote under the proposals, has already expressed its opposition..\"The 'big six' are using Covid to seize power.\"If that happens, over time they will increasingly use this reform for their own interests,\" a West Ham source told the BBC..Read also: The UK government has also condemned the idea, with its Department for Culture, Media and Sport describing it as a \"backroom deal\" that would \"create a closed system at the top of football\".\"Sustainability, integrity and fair competition are absolutely paramount and anything that could compromise them is deeply troubling,\" he added..Finally, the Football Supporters' Association said it noted \"with grave concern\" the proposals, adding that they had \"far-reaching implications for the whole of domestic football\"..\"Once again it seems that major decisions in football are apparently being discussed behind our backs by billionaire club owners who continue to view football as their personal fiefdom,\" she said in a statement..Why save the small clubs? Chesterfield's epic run to the FA Cup semi-finals in 1997 was a significant moment in the town's history.Most English towns have a football team that plays at some level, and this gives that town an identity within the country as a whole..Just one example: the town of Accrington doesn't get many visitors, but most older Britons know their team, Accrington Stanley, thanks to an advertising campaign in which they starred..Indeed, the way the BBC decides whether a city is well-known enough to not have to give geographical details when its journalists write about it is whether it has a club in the Football League..And when a small football club achieves unexpected success in a cup competition – when Chesterfield reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 1997, for example – it puts a town on the map and has a massive impact on civic pride..But many of these teams are on the brink..If they disappear, it will not only affect the football pyramid, but will break the hearts of already struggling post-industrial communities..This is why the pressure is so strong for some sort of bailout..This is why the FEL is so enthusiastic about these proposals..And that's precisely the pressure that some big clubs think they can take advantage of.."}
