Celebrities like Selena Gomez and the Jenner sisters seem to have nailed the recipe for instant Instagram success. Here's a reminder of the pictures earning all our likes. 2 - Selena Gomez Before Beyonce knocked her off the top spot, the 24-year-old singer had posted the most liked photo on Instagram ever. This photo of her holding a coke cola bottle has 6.33 million likes. Follow this link to see the second most popular video on Instagram. 3 - Kendall Jenner This is the photo posted by Kendall Jenner earlier this year. She managed to beat Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's wedding photo from last year, which has racked up 2.4 million likes. In 2016, a photo of Kendall lying on the floor with her hair arranged in heart shapes became the photo-sharing app's most liked picture ever at the time. It now has 3.65 million likes. Instagram's top 10 globally is based on most likes and comments. 4 & 5 - Taylor Swift In fourth and fifth place is Taylor Swift, who is on Instagram's top ten list no less than three times. Her photo of a bunch of roses sent to her by Kanye West, puts her in fourth place. The rapper sent her white roses to say sorry - the photo now has 2.6 million likes. The apology came after Kanye interrupted Taylor's acceptance speech for best female video award at the 2009 MTV Music Awards. And the singer also takes fifth place because of a photo of her cats that's received 2.5 million likes. She frequently features Dr. Meredith Grey and Detective Olivia Benson on her Instagram and you should know them quite well by the end of this list. The singer said her cat was \"allergic to joy\" in the picture. 6 - Kim Kardashian Back when Kim Kardashian got hitched to Kanye West in 2014, she posted a photo of the couple exchanging vows. Since then, it has soared up the Insta-charts to number six and at the time of writing, has been liked 2.49 million times.

{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content into one sentence.\nThe race to become East Africa's biggest port\nThe Kenyan port of Mombasa and Tanzania's Dar es Salaam port are the traditional competitors but the Kenyan government is now planning a huge new port at Lamu, while Tanzania is developing Bagamoyo. Both ports will be larger than any other port in sub-Saharan Africa if completed as planned. They will also be at the centre of much bigger developments, with industrial zones being laid out and intensive farming being proposed. The Tanzanian authorities hope Bagamoyo will handle 20 million containers a year, that is 25 times larger than the port at Dar es Salaam. Kenya's planned Lamu port is expected to be just as big. However, these are the proposed, long term figures, which will be achieved over decades rather than years. Construction will take place in phases as and when required. The scale of the initial phases has not been determined but will be much more modest. One hurdle that is delaying the development of both projects is the question of compensation. In the case of Bagamoyo, 2,000 people have lost their homes or farmland to the project and associated industrial zone. The Tanzanian government says that it will pay a total of $20.9m (£14.4m). But the figure would be much higher if there was a plan to enlarge the Dar es Salaam port as it is already surrounded by urban development and has limited room for expansion. Apart from serving their own domestic markets, the Tanzanian and Kenyan ports will also be competing for a wider prize, the business from the landlocked countries of East Africa. They could handle containers travelling to and from Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan, Ethiopia, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and parts of Zambia. Lamu and Bagamoyo have been little used as ports for about a century but at one point they were rivals in East Africa's slave trade. Indeed, the name Bagamoyo derives from a Swahili phrase meaning lay down your heart, or give up hope, suggesting that slaves taken there had no hope of escape. But with the revamped ports they could become better known for helping develop the region rather than bleeding it dry of its human resources. Construction work on Bagamoyo is to begin before the end of this year, once financing is put in place by China Merchant Holding International and the State General Reserve Fund, which is an Omani sovereign wealth fund. Preliminary work has already begun on Lamu, although funding is still being finalised. New life is also being injected into the Tanzanian port of Tanga. The government managed to persuade Uganda to route its planned oil export line through Tanzania to Tanga, rather than through Lamu. In addition, a new railway could run parallel to the pipeline connecting with ferry services on Lake Victoria. Tanzania won the fight over the pipeline because it was offering the cheaper option and, probably, also because any line to Lamu was seen as being vulnerable to attack from the Somalia-based Islamist al-Shabab group. A big difference between the two countries approaches is the fact that Kenya has stuck with state ownership. The Kenya Ports Authority continues to own and manage most of Mombasa, while Dar es Salaam container terminal is operated by Tanzania International Container Terminal Services, an offshoot of Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa. Similarly, Bagamoyo will be operated by China Merchant Holdings, a sign of how the country has moved away from the principles of African socialism, as espoused by the country's founding father Julius Nyerere. Lamu is being developed by the China Communications Construction Company but the Kenya Ports Authority will still be in control. Railway developments The two countries are also looking at boosting their rail infrastructure. Mombasa and Dar es Salaam are connected to the rest of the region via long distance railways. A colonial-era line runs from Mombasa to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, and on to the Ugandan capital, Kampala. It was nicknamed the Lunatic Express because of the problems involved in building it across difficult terrain filled with hostile wildlife. A new, more modern railway is now under construction from Mombasa to Nairobi with Chinese funding. For its part, Dar es Salaam is connected to Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika, also by colonial-period railways. In addition, the Tanzania-Zambia Railway was built in the 1970s by the Chinese government to help Zambia export its copper through Dar es Salaam. This allowed it to bypass the ports of apartheid South Africa or colonial-era Mozambique. New railways from Lamu to South Sudan and Ethiopia are planned, while funding is currently being sought for a new line from Rwanda and Burundi to either Dar es Salaam or Bagamoyo. Bagamoyo lies just 75km (47 miles) north of Dar es Salaam, so it should be relatively easy to connect the new port to the country's main rail lines. Tanzania appears to be winning projects in the face of Kenyan competition because of lower costs and because, as with the Uganda oil pipeline, any railway or pipeline out of Lamu could be vulnerable to attack by Somali militants. But the competition is not over and the rivalry could serve to boost the business prospects for the whole region."}

The scheme was originally due to run weekly but will run once a month due to operating costs of £195,000. Baldwin Street, King Street and all roads in the Old City will be closed during car-free Sundays. Mr Ferguson said five days were planned this summer, with the first on 23 June. The £195,000 cost covers all five days. 'Suck it and see' He said he had been inspired by similar schemes in Bordeaux in France and Bogota in Colombia. \"I'm very keen on taking a 'suck it and see' approach and this is why we're starting on a monthly basis - if it's a success we'll move it into a weekly basis,\" Mr Ferguson said. \"I want people to feel their way and see how they to respond to it. \"It will have some costs in the early stages while we set it up, but in time I hope it becomes a natural thing with a very low cost.\" He added the money would pay for marshalling the road closures and also to provide some of the entertainment. Blue badge spaces People will still be able to drive in to the city as there will be routes to the main car parks, Mr Ferguson said. He also said there would also be provision for disabled drivers and public transport would be largely unaffected. \"I don't think you can close it [the city centre] off completely but I think we can make a large amount of it pedestrian or certainly mixed use,\" Mr Ferguson said. Nick Licata who owns the Brigstow Cafe on Clare Street said he preferred the monthly plan to the original weekly idea. He said: \"I think if it remains as a Sunday special thing, if it remains once a month - then it will work. \"But we don't want this leading into a long term plan of banning cars from the city centre.\""}

Two 999 and two 101 calls were made between 16:00 BST and 18:15, but no-one arrived until 18:40. He was eventually taken to Bedford Hospital in a Bedfordshire Police car. \"It was miscommunication, the left hand didn't seem to know what the right hand was doing,\" he said. Mr Collins, a service engineer from Everton, near Sandy, was riding on the B645, near where the borders of Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire meet, when he crashed into a ditch to avoid oncoming traffic. Timeline of emergency calls Mr Collins said a member of the public made the first 999 call at 16:00 and left shortly afterwards. But when no-one had arrived by 17:15 he called emergency services himself and was told an ambulance and police car were on their way. He then made further calls at 18:10 and 18:15, before a police car arrived nearly half an hour later. \"It was very painful and uncomfortable as my forearm was bent at right-angles,\" he said. \"I was being passed from pillar-to-post. Apparently there's been an apology, but I haven't received it personally. \"All the police forces need to look at their emergency call procedures, especially when dealing with cases on their borders.\" A Cambridgeshire Police spokesman said investigations have since confirmed the incident did take place in Bedfordshire by a few metres, but stated \"it remains clear that a better response should have been given by all three forces\". Bedfordshire Police has referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. East Midlands Ambulance Service said it was asked to attend the call, which was outside its patch, but due to the high level of emergencies and because Mr Collins' condition was deemed non-life threatening, it could not respond \"as quickly as we would have liked\"."}

The Libyan government is fighting an insurgency by rebel forces under Gen Khalifa Haftar, based in eastern Libya. Gen Haftar is backed by Egypt and the UAE, while the UN-backed government is supported by Turkey and its ally Qatar. Rebel forces have been trying to capture Tripoli and were blamed for an air strike on a military academy on Saturday that killed at least 30 people. They denied any involvement. The Turkish government has given no details about the scale of the military deployment. \"Our soldiers' duty there is co-ordination. They will develop the operation centre there. Our soldiers are gradually going right now,\" President Erdogan told the CNN Turk TV channel. He said Turkey's objective was \"not to fight\" but \"to support the legitimate government and avoid a humanitarian tragedy\". The UN Security Council is expected to meet behind closed doors on Monday to discuss the situation in Libya, AFP news agency reported, citing diplomats. What do other countries think about the Turkish action? It has been condemned by several countries, including the US. Last week, President Donald Trump told Mr Erdogan in a phone call that \"foreign interference is complicating the situation in Libya\". Egypt said military intervention in Libya was a \"matter of Egyptian national security\" and it would defeat efforts seeking \"to control\" its neighbour, news agency Reuters reports.

Nearly 100 flood warnings remain across the UK - six of them in England severe, meaning there is a danger to life. The severe warnings are across the Midlands near the Welsh border around the Rivers Lugg, Severn and Wye. 'I could hear someone shouting' Hundreds of people have been evacuated from their homes due to floods, with the worst-affected areas including south Wales, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. In Gloucestershire, more than 300 people staying on a travellers' site have been stranded by flood water. Also in the county, a man has told of how he waded into floodwater to rescue a woman who had been trapped on the roof of her submerged car for 12 hours. Mark Smith, 51, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme: \"I could hear someone shouting for help. She was half in the car and half in the water.\" In Wales, a blockage believed to have caused flooding in a village was found to have been caused by woodland cut down by Natural Resources Wales, a government-sponsored body. Earlier, firefighters in Brecon rescued a woman who was clinging to a branch in a fast-flowing river. In Coalbrookdale, Shropshire, Chris Harrison said he had \"lost everything\" after his cafe was flooded twice in two days. He said volunteers turned up at 06:00 GMT on Sunday to help sweep out the mud - only to see it flooded once again on Monday. \"I don't know what we will do until it dries, which could take weeks. I've got no money coming in and a mortgage to pay but I'm also worried about my staff,\" he told the BBC. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced criticism from opposition parties for not visiting flood-hit communities. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was showing his \"true colours by his absence\", adding that the prime minister was sending a \"clear message\" by not convening the government's emergency committee, Cobra. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price also questioned why Mr Johnson had not convened Cobra. Fire Brigades Union general secretary Matt Wrack said his union had been raising the issue of long-term planning to deal with extreme weather events for years, but had found the government's response to be \"lacklustre\". On Wednesday, business minister Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News the prime minister was focused on getting \"money out the door\" to businesses and local authorities in affected communities. \"He wants to help people by getting funding to them,\" Mr Zahawi said. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the government was investing £2.6bn in flood defences. There was heavy rain across northern and western parts of Britain overnight and during Thursday. In Cumbria, in Honister Pass, 178mm of rain fell in 24 hours, while in Seathwaite 158mm of rain was recorded. According to the Environment Agency, England has already received 141% of its average February rainfall so far this month. River levels in the Colne, Ribble, Calder, Aire, Trent, Severn, Wye, Lugg, and Derwent all set new records in recent days, it added. Earlier, floods led to disruption across parts of the rail network, affecting Avanti West Coast, Northern and TransPennine Express services and some routes in Wales. Meanwhile, charity the RSPCA said animal rescue officers had been called out more than 200 times in the past 72 hours - including for \"dramatic rescues\" of 60 sheep, horses, a swan and chickens.

She accused the current Republican nominee of grabbing her breast and making objectifying statements about her to other men in his group. Mr Trump's campaign dismissed the claim as a \"fictional story\". \"Discredited political operative Gloria Allred, in another coordinated, publicity seeking attack with the Clinton campaign, will stop at nothing to smear Mr. Trump.

Mr Trump, at the final televised presidential debate in Las Vegas, called his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton \"such a nasty woman\". Speaking at a press conference in Los Angeles alongside her lawyer Gloria Allred, Mrs Virginia recounted her alleged encounter with Mr Trump when she was 27 years old.

We haven't seen her before,'\" Mrs Virginia tearfully recounted, saying that his words described her \"as though I was an object rather than a person\". \"Then his hand touched the right inside of my breast. I was in shock. I flinched.\" She told reporters that Mr Trump then said to her: \"Don't you know who I am?\" \"I felt intimidated and I felt powerless,\" she said, explaining that the incident left her feeling \"ashamed\" and that she blamed herself for many years. Mrs Allred - who is a vocal supporter of Mrs Clinton - insisted that her legal office was not working in co-ordination with the Clinton campaign, and that Mrs Virginia had sought her help to announce the accusation. She said that there were no corroborating witnesses to the incident, but that Mrs Virginia had recounted the story to friends soon after, and also later to her husband."}

However it is only planning to recruit 900 workers in the coming months. The recruitment process began this week with the department advertising for 350 work coaches to support those being made redundant. In a statement the DfC revealed the Universal Credit caseload had doubled as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. A spokesperson said: \"The department is planning to recruit 900 staff, from both internal and external competitions, in the coming weeks and months to help deal with increased social welfare claims. \"As part of this recruitment exercise the Department has launched a competition to recruit 350 work coaches to help assist people affected by the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic. \"The posts will be three year fixed contacts, with the possibility of an extension after that time\".

Mr Johal has not been formally charged with any crime. His family say he was in India on holiday having married there in October. Indian police have accused Mr Johal of financing the purchase of weapons used to kill Hindu leaders.

His lawyer said he was now accused of involvement in the death of a priest in Ludhiana in July 2015. During Foreign Office questions in the Commons, Mr Johal's local MP, the SNP's Martin Docherty-Hughes, raised the case, and asked what discussions Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson had had with the Indian government about their human rights record in Punjab.

These new \"robo-taxis\" would be so cheap to use that it just wouldn't be worth owning a car any more, and this transformation could happen very quickly - in as little as a decade - or so the argument runs. The results would transform the way we live. I acknowledged that the idea was controversial and invited readers to respond. And you did. Thousands of you. Lots of readers thought this brave new world of self-driving vehicles sounded great. But more doubted whether it would really come to pass. So we recruited some experts to explore your concerns and to help try and work out just how likely it is that the age of the private automobile really will soon be over. Let's take each element of this revolution separately. Find out more Listen to Justin's Business Daily programme on The Electric Robotaxi Dream. Will electric cars really prove viable? First off, the cars. Many of you asked whether there would really be enough lithium or cobalt in the world to make all the batteries they would need, for example. Step up Michael Liebreich, a sustainability expert who runs a clean energy and transportation consultancy in London. There's no shortage of either element in the world, he says, the real issue is whether the mining industry has the capacity to dig the stuff out, and there's been huge investment in putting that in place as demand has risen. Mr Liebreich reels off statistics suggesting that we have already entered the era of the electric car: four million have already been sold, and he predicts the next million will hit the streets in just six months. Lots of mainstream forecasters now reckon that there'll be more than 100 million electric vehicles on the world's roads by 2030. Not quite the wholescale upheaval I talked about - there could be nearly two billion cars in total on the roads by then - but a very significant development nonetheless. Will we ever want to surrender control of our vehicles to a computer? Lots of you talked about the sense of freedom driving gives; the thrill of putting the pedal to the metal. The response of CarlitosWay was fairly typical: \"If you think I'm giving up burning off boy racers at the lights in my Jag, think again suckers.\" I'll bowl that one to Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University who found time to set up an artificial intelligence (AI) company that was snapped up by Uber. He acknowledges that driving can be a very \"liberating experience\" but says that doesn't mean we'll always do it, or always should do it. \"Eventually it will be a safety issue,\" says Prof Marcus. \"There will come a day when driverless cars are just much safer than people.\" But - and there is a big but here - he doesn't think the transition to self-driving vehicles is going to happen in the next 10 years. He thinks it could be a couple of decades before autonomous technology is up to the challenge of driving a car safely. That will come as a surprise to those who have watched in awe at the success of AI programs like Google subsidiary DeepMind's AlphaZero. Within two hours of taking up chess AlphaZero was beating human players; after four it was beating the best chess computer in the world; in nine it was the best chess player the world has ever seen. But Prof Marcus says progress on self-driving cars has been nowhere near as rapid. The problem is that driving is a lot more complex and unpredictable than chess. Why is getting a computer to drive a car so difficult? It turns out the challenge of getting a vehicle to control itself is a perfect illustration of the limits of current AI: computers may be able to do some things way better than even the very cleverest of humans, but often fail at tasks that even the stupidest humans can achieve with ease. A key issue is that, when it comes to driving, you can't afford to make mistakes, points out Prof Marcus. A self-driving car that works 99.99% of the time still can't be trusted if 0.01% of the time it drives into parked vehicles or kills a pedestrian. The realisation that getting cars to navigate safely anywhere other than straightforward environments like motorways has made the ride-hailing giants a lot less bullish about the autonomous driving revolution. Uber, for example, has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in self-driving technology. Back in 2014 the company's then-boss, Travis Kalanick, was predicting that self-driving cars would replace drivers. Now the most ambitious it gets is talk of rolling out a \"hybrid network\". \"[There will be] places and times where it makes a whole lot of sense for an autonomous vehicle to pick someone up, and there will be other places and times and weather conditions and areas of the country where having a driver that looks a lot like what Uber looks like today will continue for quite a while,\" Uber's head of transportation policy and research, Andrew Salzberg, concedes. Will autonomous ride-hailing networks really reach rural areas? Mr Salzberg's response to this criticism may surprise you. He says some of the most dramatic changes Uber has already brought have been in the smaller towns and rural areas in California. He says that it used to be hard to hail a taxi in the more remote areas of Uber's heartland, but claims the company can now offer many users five or 10-minute response times. The key is the size of the network, says Mr Salzberg. Uber now has sufficient customers - in California at least - to generate enough rides to make driving a taxi worthwhile even in areas with low population densities. The bottom line So here's my conclusion. Two of the three components of the autonomous revolution - electric vehicles and ride-hailing apps - appear to be coming along quite nicely. But the third - and most important - automation, still has a long way to go. Yes, you can already buy a car that will steer you along a motorway, though you'll need to keep your hands on the wheel because these technologies are officially just an advanced version of cruise control. So it's clear it is going to take much longer than 10 years before fully automated vehicles are approved, and therefore the full robo-taxi revolution can begin in earnest. It will happen - but just not as quickly as many hoped. A $120bn bet that the car's days are numbered? But in the meantime other forces are undermining our attachment to our automobiles. Last month Uber began the process of floating itself on the US stock market. It will be one of the biggest initial public offerings in history, with talk of the company being valued at as much as $120bn and that's despite posting losses topping $1bn in the three months to September. So why could the company carry such a huge price tag? It is because Uber is at the vanguard of the battle for the future of one of the biggest businesses on the planet - transportation. There's lots of evidence that the market is already beginning to change - just look at UK car sales. Gone are the days when a gleaming new car was something we all aspired to. Increasingly twentysomethings don't even bother to pass the driving test because these days there are lots of alternatives to the car. That is certainly the argument Uber's Andrew Salzberg makes. He predicts that many millennials will never own a car. \"People choose things that are convenient for them,\" he says. Uber's focus now is to offer a range of travel alternatives, recently investing in electric bike rental and electric scooters. \"It is faster in the morning commute here in San Francisco to take a bike to work, but late at night you may need a car to the airport,\" Mr Salzberg says. Lots of other companies are snapping at Uber's heels, coming up with new ways to provide cheap and efficient ways for us all to get around. So even if the robo-taxi revolution is a way off there are lots of new reasons you may decide not to shell out on a car of your own."}

The Newry and Armagh MLA said the construction in his constituency would be an \"ugly scar\". Previously Ms Mallon said the proposal would bring economic benefits. Speaking on Inside Politics Q&A, Mr McNulty was asked if he had been given a hearing by the minister to which he replied: \"I don't think she has listened to me enough.\" 'Sad and short-sighted' He described the decision by his party colleague as \"very sad and short-sighted\". Planning approval for the North-South Electricity Interconnector was announced last week by Nichola Mallon. The project will create an 85-mile-long (138km) overhead electricity line stretching from County Tyrone to County Meath. Previous applications have been quashed by court rulings, with the decision returning to the department. Ms Mallon said the proposal will enhance network stability and bring economic benefits. The minister said: \"Following the quashing of the previous decision, I have carefully reconsidered the proposal and the up-to-date environmental information and have concluded that planning permission should be granted for the development which remains of strategic importance for our island economy.\" There were more than 6,000 letters of objection to the original proposal and more than 3,500 since a consolidated environmental statement was submitted. Sinn Fein MLA Liz Kimmins also told Inside Politics Q&A that her party was \"disappointed, as are the thousands who objected to it\". 'Concerns for farmers' She said her party had campaigned to have the interconnector placed underground. The DUP MLA William Irwin said there was an \"inevitability\" about the interconnector getting the go-ahead. He said he would like see the interconnector underground, and added that he did have \"concerns for farmers\".

{"instruction": "Please summarize the following content into one sentence.\nBrexit becomes Corbyn's PMQs focus\nBy Sebastien AshBBC Political Research Unit Since the turn of the year, two fifths of the Labour leader's questions have been about the United Kingdom's imminent departure from the European Union and Mr Corbyn now seems more determined to challenge the government consistently on this issue. In the last 10 PMQs, Corbyn has chosen to address Brexit with 42 out of a possible 60 questions - exactly 70% of the time. Of the 14 that weren't about Brexit, six were about buses and another eight were about the NHS, although two of these followed on from a line of questioning about Theresa May's promise to pour a supposed \"Brexit dividend\" back into healthcare. Of course, there are different ways of classifying his questions - a question can be about more than one subject - but by my reckoning this has made Brexit the most common theme of Mr Corbyn's questions since he became leader. Despite this, Mr Corbyn has been criticised in the past for skirting the issue, when he has the opportunity to put the government on the spot. In total, since the EU referendum on 23 June 2016, he has asked 105 questions about Brexit. That equates to just over 27% of all the questions he has asked in that time. But they haven't come in one steady stream. Between 25 January and 22 November 2017, Mr Corbyn only referred to Brexit in one question, and that - on 25 October - was to list the lack of no-deal planning alongside a number of other examples of alleged government incompetence. The prime minister had no trouble evading the issue in her response. Mr Corbyn did respond to statements made to the House by the prime minister after key EU summits and after PMQs on 29 March 2017, the day Article 50 was triggered. But PMQs is an opportunity for the leader of the opposition to take the initiative and to drive the debate. Over those 10 months, he chose instead to speak about public sector pay cuts, the sweetheart deal for Surrey Council, Theresa May holding Donald Trump's hand, changes to National Insurance for the self-employed, zero hours contracts, universal credit, tax avoidance, school places, Grenfell Tower and the NHS. It was left to Emily Thornberry to probe the government on Brexit when she deputised for Mr Corbyn on 12 July 2017. The shadow foreign secretary grilled then deputy prime minister Damian Green with six straight questions about the government's no-deal planning. The picture has gradually changed since. As Labour has shifted towards a softer position on Brexit, Mr Corbyn has begun to ramp up the pressure in PMQs. There was a clutch of 12 questions at the end of 2017 and another dozen at the end of February, before he turned the heat up from May. Critics might complain about Mr Corbyn's execution, but they can no longer say that he is not talking about Brexit. All of which goes to prove the old adage: you wait for one Brexit question and then 42 come along all at once."}

A shuttle service was only reinstated on 2 July. The firm told Cumbria councillors a lack of trained drivers meant it had \"no choice\" but to halt services. A representative from the company faced tough questions at a meeting of Cumbria County Council's South Lakeland Local Committee earlier. Council deputy leader Ian Stewart said: \"It was obvious in the responses Northern gave to members' questions that the Lakes Line had been sacrificed. \"They moved resources away from the Lakes Line. That's appalling. \"There have been inconsistencies in the way Northern have operated in our area compared to others areas within the franchise.\" Pete Myers, stakeholder manager for Northern, said: \"We are part of a network and it was in this region particularly that driver training requirements were most prevalent. That's why the decision was made to suspend services. \"There was certainly no disrespecting the Lake District or not recognising how import Windermere is as a tourist destination, but there was really no choice at the time.\" Mr Myers said the introduction of new timetables meant rolling stock had to be relocated and that trains moved on to the Lakes Line required drivers to undergo additional training. \"It's not like a car, you can't just jump into a train and drive it. Drivers had to be trained and that is the position we were in\", he added.

The US-based firm has 48 million subscribers in over 40 countries. One analyst said the success of the latest rollout might depend on how much content was dubbed into local languages. \"Germany potentially could be quite a difficult market as it has low pay-TV penetration and seemingly low willingness to pay,\" said Ian Maude from the media consultancy Enders Analysis. \"One thing I'm curious to see in Germany is whether or not it has dubbed a lot of the show for the market because - while French TV has a lot of subtitling - in Germany foreign language movies and TV shows are generally voiced over, and that can be quite an expensive process.\" Germany's large number of broadband users - the fourth biggest such population in the world - makes it a potentially lucrative market. However, Netflix will have to compete against video-on-demand incumbents including Sky Deutschland's Snap, Vivendi's Watchever, ProSiebenSat.1's MaxDome and Amazon Instant Video. In France, it faces the prospect of competing against a rival that owns the rights to a series branded a \"Netflix exclusive\" in other territories: Vivendi's CanalPlay owns the domestic rights to the second season of the drama House of Cards in the country. Netflix also must contend with the fact that French audiovisual laws require local broadcasters to invest significant sums in domestic content. However, Les Echos newspaper has suggested Netflix might get around this by basing the service in Luxembourg. For now, the firm has only said it would provide \"further details, including pricing, programming and supported devices at a later date\". 'Figure out stuff' California-based Netflix reported profits of $53m (£32m) in its most recent quarter. Despite previous international launches - including the Netherlands last year and the UK in 2012 - the firm's revenue is mostly generated by US subscribers. Netflix's most recent figures stated that it had 11.8 million members paying for streaming content outside the US at the end of March but about three times that figure within the country. The firm has previously said that it became profitable in Canada within two years of launch, but has not released similar information about its other foreign ventures. However, chief executive Reed Hastings recently said the company recognised that it must tailor the content it provided to each audience. \"We've seen tremendous success in the Netherlands, where we launched six months ago, and that, I think, encourages us about being able to figure out the right programming formula in each nation,\" he told bank analysts in April. \"We're going to learn as we go. If we're very fortunate, we'll have programmed it completely correctly from day one. \"More likely, we'll figure out some stuff's working, some stuff's not; we'll adjust the formula.\""}

It had been struggling off shore before the tide went out, leaving it stranded. Members of British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) said the young male's prognosis had been \"incredibly poor\", even if refloating it had been possible. Intervention could have \"led to an even more prolonged and distressing death for the animal\", the group said. Sperm whales feed on large squid which are not normally found in the North Sea. For this reason those found stranded in it in the past have been \"almost always in poor nutritional condition, sometimes ill, and extremely unlikely to survive\", the BDMLR said. The death has been logged with the Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme based at the Institute of Zoology in London.

It says it wants to \"strengthen the existing network\" alongside some new developments. From 20 October until December a number of public consultations will be held. \"We are commencing the first phase to connect the major new power generation we are expecting to arrive in Anglesey,\" said Martin Kinsay, a senior project manager with National Grid. 'Large and complex project' \"We need to do that by upgrading our network and trying to maximise capacity in our existing network on the mainland,\" he added. On Wednesday it was announced that a French-Chinese consortium had dropped its bid to build an £8bn nuclear power station on Anglesey. The Horizon project to build new reactors at Wylfa and Oldbury, Gloucestershire, was put up for sale by German-owned E.ON and RWE in March. Mr Kinsay said National Grid had spoken to Horizon and they are still \"optimistic\" a buyer will be found.

Meanwhile, Rob Kapito, head of one of the world's largest investment houses Blackrock, said there was \"a lot of concern\" in the financial community. He also said voters had not been given enough facts before the EU referendum. \"The unintended consequences of Brexit will be significant for everyone across the UK,\" he said. 'Uncertainty' Mr Kelleher said his bank's immediate concern was over whether to invest further in the UK. This was because the terms of a potential Brexit deal were still unclear. \"It is that uncertainty that is causing problems,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. However, he said a bigger worry was whether banks would retain their \"passporting rights\" after Britain leaves the bloc. These rights currently allow them to trade across the bloc without the need for individual country licences. He said: \"I am convinced that London will retain its reputation as a prestigious global financial services centre. \"But clearly some size of our businesses will have to be moved out of London into European headquarters with the absence of any passporting agreement - but it's very hard to ascertain what that will mean at the moment.\" He also said Brexit was damaging efforts to implement the Capital Markets Union, a European Commission initiative to bolster the low use of capital markets to finance European companies and infrastructure projects. Mr Kelleher noted banks still finance 80% of lending on the continent. For this reason he urged UK ministers and Brussels to include a \"long transitional period\" for banks as part of any Brexit deal. His comments were echoed by Mr Kapito, whose firm Blackrock manages assets worth almost $5tn (£3.8tn). \"I don't think there is any good [financial services] firm that has not already started to look at real estate in different areas outside the UK in case they have to move larger operations,\" Mr Kapito said. \"There is no one that doesn't have people looking at tax implications, investment implications, manufacturing implications.\" He said the decision to leave the EU could have a big impact on financial companies' staff, too. This is because many work \"cross border\" and many \"have spouses that work cross border\". \"There are very few answers to the questions will they be able to maintain their jobs, will they have to move home, where [Europe's] the financial centre might move to,\" he said."}

It comes as millions of people can now enjoy new freedoms as lockdown is eased in England, Wales and most of Scotland. But the government has warned its next review of social distancing rules may be delayed. No 10 said the Indian variant \"could pose a threat\" to the process of deciding whether all remaining lockdown restrictions could be eased on 21 June. Mr Hancock told the House of Commons there were now 2,323 confirmed cases of the Indian variant in the UK. This means there has been a 77% increase in confirmed cases of the variant over the last five days. \"There are now 86 local authorities where there are five or more confirmed cases,\" he said. There are 343 local authorities in England. Mr Hancock said the Indian variant was now the dominant strain of the virus in Bolton as well as Blackburn and Darwen and was rising in all age groups. He said most people in hospital in those areas had been eligible for a vaccine but had chosen not to have it - and urged anyone not sure whether to get jabbed to \"look at what's happening in Bolton\". Bedford was also fast becoming a hotspot for the variant, Mr Hancock said, and surge testing would begin there. Scientists believe the Indian variant does spread more easily, but early data suggests vaccines still work. The exact impact on vaccine efficacy - if any - is yet to be confirmed. People aged 37 and over in England will be able to get the vaccine from Tuesday, he said - and the rollout would continue to be expanded later in the week. Lockdown eases across UK: The lockdown changes on Monday - which are different in England, Wales and Scotland - have seen thousands of people heading off on foreign holidays, flocking to bingo halls and drinking inside pubs again. People have also taken the chance to finally hug loved ones as the guidance on close contact were changed. Hospital ward manager Viv Hudson, 58, wept with joy as she finally hugged her daughter, Theresa Fox, for the first time in more than a year. \"It's a bit weird - but a good kind of weird. I've missed this so much,\" said Theresa, 38, who also works for the NHS. \"While we can take this step today, we must be humble in the face of this virus,\" said Mr Hancock. He pointed out that fewer than 1,000 people were now in hospital with the virus - the first time this has happened since last September. Latest figures show another 1,976 cases have been recorded across the UK and a further five people have died. Meanwhile, the number of people who have received their first vaccine dose has topped 36.7 million, and more than 20.2 million second doses have been given. Should we be celebrating the easing of restrictions or worried by the continued spread of a new variant? The big picture is we are in a much better place than the start of the year - when around 1.25 million people were estimated to have the virus and the NHS was feeling the pressure. Now there are fewer than 1,000 people in hospital with Covid - 97% lower than the peak. However, we are in a transitional phase as the burden of suppressing the virus is shifting from lockdowns to the vaccine. That process is not yet complete. It means there is still the potential for a more transmissible variant to cause a spike in cases and people needing hospital treatment. There is still uncertainty about how transmissible B1617.2 is and in turn how great a threat it poses. However, the planned easing in mid-June is already in significant doubt. The government's plan was to end all remaining limits on social contact from 21 June - which would mean unlimited numbers of guests at weddings and nightclubs allowed to reopen. Ahead of this happening, a review was set to happen by the end of May. But earlier, the prime minister's official spokesman said: \"The Indian variant could pose a threat to this process - our decision will be based on latest data. We will set out plans as soon as the data allows.\" Asked whether ministers would consider a return to a tier system of rules, the spokesman said they did not want to talk about hypothetical situations but \"we don't want to rule anything out\"."}

From Damascus and Hama to Aleppo and the seaside city of Latakia, through six years of war in which hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives and more than 12 million have been forced from their homes, the Girl Guides have continued. 'Sense of normality' Women first started holding Guide meetings in Syria in the 1950s and they are being granted full membership of the movement's worldwide body this week. The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (Wagggs) praised the Syria groups' \"incredible work\" at giving their more than 1,000 members \"a sense of normality\" and \"a safe space to play and make friends\". \"Everyone thinks that we're all dying. Actually we are having a normal life,\" says Sham, a 22-year-old student who lives in Damascus, the capital. That might seem incongruous - Damascus has been rocked by suicide bombings and air strikes and has seen battles between rebels and the government. But in any war the intensity of conflict depends on where you are. In government-held Damascus, cafes and markets have stayed open against a backdrop of shelling, even as other cities have been destroyed, displaced families have been left destitute, and millions more people have left Syria altogether. Living in a middle-class part of the capital, Sham knows how lucky she is. \"The war has taken its toll on my country, however, I am thankful it hasn't affected me in person,\" she says. \"Instead, it's made me stronger and helped me realise what I want to do in life. I know now that studying is the key to everything. \"Girl Guides has helped me no end and it's one of the reasons I consider myself successful. \"I am a part of the efforts of rebuilding Syria because I am a leader in the Scout movement.\" Sham even went to Sudan earlier this year to train Girl Guides there in body confidence. Since she took part in the scheme, she has stopped wearing make up altogether and wants other girls to feel proud of their bodies. While in the UK Guides have traditionally been associated with Christianity, Sham is a Sunni Muslim and says the members come from different religions and celebrate both Eid and Christmas together. \"No one would even ask\" her religion, she says. Girl Guides were banned in Syria in 1980 along with other youth organisations, as the ruling party tried to consolidate power. One woman, Rim, had been a member since she was six years old and the movement meant so much to her, she flouted the ban to hold meetings in a local church. Girl Guides groups started to re-form in 2000 after the ban was lifted, and Rim is now a leader, a board member and a training co-ordinator. She says it has made her a \"strong, confident woman\" and she tries to pass that on to the girls in her charge by organising guest speakers including writers and businesswomen. \"Not only in Syria but in the Middle East women have not reached the position that they should be in yet,\" she says. \"The community still thinks that women cannot be decision makers or independent. It is hard to persuade people that even though I am a woman, I can still be a leader, a decision-maker and be able to create positive change. \"Girls are the key to our future. They are capable of amazing things.\" Syria's Girl Guides Promise: \"On my honour, I promise that I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country, to help others and to obey the Girl Guide law.\" Some of Rim's friends have died or had to leave, and she can no longer travel around the country to go hiking at the weekend as she used to. When the Girl Guides in Syria go camping, they have to check with the army beforehand that the area around their campsite is safe. And in such a divided country, it is difficult to be as inclusive as they might like. They operate in government-held areas. Their events use the national flag of Syria, the anthem and the national motto - contentious symbols all. Even the Syrian version of the promise - a pledge Girl Guides are invited to make when they join - mentions duty to one's country. It is not inconceivable that this would stop families who oppose the government of Bashar al-Assad from sending their daughters to meetings. Rim says that is not the case and some parents who \"object to\" the government do send their children. \"The Guides and Scouts is a movement that is not political,\" she says. \"The promise is promising for the country and not for a specific government. \"It is for the country. It is for Syria.\" Sham agrees: \"We never talk about politics. It's open for everyone. Christians, Muslims, everyone.\" A guide to Guides"}

The figures were released to coincide with a campaign to raise awareness on the issue and highlight help available. Det Sup Ian Critchley said the \"number one aim\" was \"to stop children being abused in the first place\". He said he believed recent prominent court cases around exploitation had encouraged more victims to come forward. 'Went along with it' The force is working with other professionals in health care and social services as part of Child Sexual Exploitation Awareness Week. Children have been groomed and abused by people they meet online, older boyfriends or people in positions of trust, police said. The abuser might try to make someone feel special or loved, promise them things or even threaten or bribe them. When Ryan, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, was 13 he ended up in a sexually abusive relationship with a man ten years older who he met on a social media website. \"I'd received all the warnings and seen it on TV about not talking to strangers, but I just thought something like that wouldn't happen to me,\" he said. He said he met up with the man and they developed a relationship. \"I think I thought I was a lot more mature than I was and because I'd never been in a serious relationship, I didn't know what to expect so I just went along with it.\" Ryan said he went to the police when he found out the man was contacting his friends and he realised he had been exploited. \"If I look back I can see he was using me to get to other people,\" he said. \"Sometimes I wake up and remember it and I get upset and depressed and I feel horrible, but I got through it.\""}

Turkey has been fighting Kurdish rebels in the country's southeast for decades. Many Kurds have been campaigning for autonomy and better cultural rights. Lessons in the Kurdish language will be granted in schools if enough students asked for them, Mr Erdogan said. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in nearly 30 years of fighting between Turkey's government and the banned Kurdish separatist group, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Tuesday's announcement is the latest in recent reforms introduced by Turkey to ease tensions with the Kurdish minority, who account for about 20% of Turkey's population. 'Oppression' While the move is a significant concession to Kurds, the BBC's Jonathan Head in Istanbul says Mr Erdogan will have to do more to win the trust of Kurdish politicians. Gultan Kisanak of the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy party said permitting lessons on only an elective basis \"amounts to oppression\". University-level language courses in Kurdish and other minority languages were introduced in 2009, a move widely welcomed by rights groups. The EU has still urged the Turkish government to improve anti-discrimination laws for all minorities in the country and do more to tackle racism. Kurdish rights remain a sensitive issue in Turkey, where political organisation along ethnic lines is banned by the constitution. Use of the Kurdish language by Kurdish politicians has in the past provoked uproar from Turkish officials. High-profile Kurdish activist and member of parliament Leyla Zana caused an outcry in 1991 when she took the parliamentary oath in her mother tongue. Last month Mrs Zana was sentenced to 10 years in prison for spreading propaganda on behalf of the PKK."}

Over three days, Union troops held off Confederate soldiers, paving the way for the eventual victory of the north over the south and the reunification of the United States. A slate of events will be held at the site of the battle over the weekend. But the political atmosphere in America has given rise to fake rumours about the potential for vandalism and violence at the site. Among the rumours is a report that far-left \"antifa\" (short for \"anti-fascist\") activists are planning to destroy Confederate gravestones. The rumours initially seem credible, but there's a problem: although there is a cemetery at Gettysburg, no Confederate graves at the site are marked by stones. Potent symbol Gettysburg commemorations have previously prompted rallies by free speech and pro-Confederate protesters, along with counter-protests by their opponents. In March 2016, for instance, a few hundred protesters and counter-protesters gathered at the site. Police kept both sides apart. This year, multiple blogs and conservative websites indicated that protesters were planning to burn Confederate flags or desecrate Confederate graves. While Gettysburg National Military Park officials are prepared for protests, rally organisers say violence is not expected. The Confederate flag has long been controversial. Its supporters say it's a symbol of the region which represents freedom and liberty, while its opponents point out that the Confederacy was built on the slave labour of African-Americans, an issue that was at the heart of the US Civil War. In the wake of the mass shooting of black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015, a movement emerged to try to get the flag removed from public spaces. In May, New Orleans became the latest city to remove its Confederate statues. At the same time, clashes involving far-right and far-left protesters have become more common on American streets. More on this story Hear a special edition of BBC Trending on the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement What does the slogan 'Black Lives Matter' mean now? America's extremist battle: antifa v alt-right So why the confusion? Inserted into this story have been online troublemakers intent on fooling their political opponents. Earlier this year, a Facebook event created by a group called \"Trolling Trumpsters\" suggested that people \"desecrate Confederate Cemeteries\" on Confederate Memorial Day in May. It was widely shared online. The event suggested that protesters target the Marietta Confederate Cemetery, which contains more than 3,000 graves of Confederate soldiers. The event prompted outrage - but no actual vandalism. Supporters of the Confederate flag turned up at the cemetery on 13 May. Local reports indicated that the group included \"heavily armed\" and alleged members of the Ku Klux Klan, but no one from the \"Trolling Trumpsters\" group appeared, and cemetery staff said they didn't notice any damage to graves. The \"Trolling Trumpsters\" group has since been deleted from Facebook but by looking at archived copies of the site, it is possible to see that it was focused on creating anti-Trump memes and making events which would bait and upset conservatives. For instance, they also planned a second event which almost 1,000 people said they would attend at Gettysburg, where they have threatened to burn a Confederate flag. People who tried to buy \"tickets\" for the event were directed to the donations page for the Southern Poverty Law Centre. The group's event appears to be the origin of the rumours about the attempted Confederate grave vandalism. Links to the events were shared onto a Civil War enthusiasts web forum and from there was picked up on by right-wing bloggers and news sites. Several blogs documented their attempts to use Facebook's reporting systems to shut down the group, while others pointed to it as an example of how militant political activists are trying to undermine Donald Trump's presidency. There will be some protests at Gettysburg this year - special permits have been granted not to antifa activists but to three conservative groups. Two of the groups are explicit Confederate flag supporters, but the third group, \"Support America and her history\" appears to be reacting to the flag-burning event, and have encouraged people to rally in support of military veterans.

Sean, from Warminster in Wiltshire, died in March 2012 from a brain haemorrhage - six weeks after he underwent corrective heart surgery. His parents say they begged doctors and nurses on the ward to help. Giving evidence at Avon Coroner's Court, Mrs Barlow said she had made a mistake when changing Sean's chest drains. She said she had not created an underwater seal, but insisted she noticed it immediately and quickly rectified it. She then failed to make a note of the error in Sean's patient records. 'Should have recorded' She said her mistake in the changing the fluid drains could have led to a condition which could have caused part or all of a lung to collapse. But a chest X-ray showed that had not happened in Sean's case. \"I think in the stress of the day I didn't put it down on the nursing notes,\" she told the hearing. \"I think I had alerted my nurse in charge, the outreach nurse and the medical staff.\" She added that she \"should have recorded it and didn't\". Mrs Barlow said her role as a cardiac nurse specialist also included non-clinical work and she worked one shift a month on Ward 32 caring for sick children. She said that because of Sean's parents' concerns and after observing his deterioration she asked for him to be examined by other nurses and doctors. Mrs Barlow said Sean had a swollen leg, was pale in colour, had a restless night and had also vomited. 'Two nurses needed' The hearing was told Sean suffered the cardiac arrest shortly after his femoral line, which was inserted in his groin, was removed by a nurse. The boy's parents, Steve and Yolande Turner, maintain that Mrs Barlow removed the femoral line on her own while Sean was being cradled in his father's arms. Hospital protocols say the procedure should be carried out by two nurses while the patient is lying horizontal. But Mrs Barlow rejected Mr and Mrs Turner's evidence and said she assisted as the nurse in charge of the ward, Sue Conner, removed Sean's femoral line. Also present, she said, was outreach nurse John Daly, and Dr Guido Pieles, a cardiac registrar. When asked if she was mistaken about her recollection, Mrs Barlow she said Sean was lying on the bed being comforted by his father. \"My recollection is that Sue Conner removed the femoral line and I assisted her and dad was comforting Sean and John Daly went to get a dressing from the dressing room,\" she said. Adam Korn, the barrister representing the Turner family, asked if it was possible she was mistaken. Mrs Barlow shrugged her shoulders in reply. Sue Conner, the nurse in charge, said she could not remember whether she was present when the femoral line was removed from Sean. The inquest continues."}

However CalMac, which is owned by the Scottish government, says its tender was cheaper than Serco's. Transport Scotland said the row will not affect a promise to discount cabins for islanders and freeze fares. The contract, due to run for at least the next six years and worth an estimated £450m, is to run publically subsidised lifeline routes between Aberdeen and Lerwick and Kirkwall, and from Scrabster to Stromness. The government say the decision on who won the bidding process was 65% based on price, and 35% on the quality of the bids. The final award of the contract is currently on standstill. A spokesman for CalMac's parent company David MacBrayne said: \"Having won the tender for the Northern Isles ferry services on price, we are in dialogue with Transport Scotland\". In a statement they added that the company was now \"analysing the detailed information we requested from them about their scoring process. \"As we are still in what is now an extended standstill period, we cannot comment further.\" In a statement, Transport Scotland said the bidding process was designed to \"attract the most economically advantageous tender based on a combination of price and quality.\" A spokesperson said: \"(Since) this is a live procurement, there is a limit on what can be said at this time, however more detailed information will be provided in due course and when it is more appropriate to do so.\" Orkney's MSP Liam MacArthur told BBC Radio Orkney that CalMac \"are within their rights to challenge the decision\". But he called on ministers to deal with the complaint quickly. \"The future of these lifeline ferry services has already been subject to an 18 month delay, with all the inevitable uncertainty that has created\", he said. \"Any further delay is therefore disappointing and should be kept to a minimum. \"Businesses and those in the Northern Isles who depend on these lifeline services deserve nothing less and cannot continue to be left in limbo\". Serco said it didn't want to comment on the issue. The new contract to run the services is due to come into effect at the end of October 2019."}

The area has produced large numbers of finds, including what have been described as exotic items from abroad. Green marble from Greece, ivory from Greenland and bronze pins from Ireland have been among the finds. A piece of bone marked with an ogham inscription, an ancient text that arrived in Scotland from Ireland, was also found. Archaeologists said the items provided a detailed picture of life in the first millennium AD. The universities of Cardiff and Sheffield have been involved in a long-term project to record South Uist's history, from the initial prehistoric colonisation through to the Clearances of the 17th and 18th centuries. A complex of mounds on the wide sweep of machair at Bornais was excavated between 1994 and 2004. What was uncovered is now being explained in a series of books. The latest published by Oxbow Books for Cardiff University details the late Iron Age history of Bornais. A later volume will explore the area's Viking past. Prof Niall Sharples, head of archaeology and conservation at Cardiff, said Bornais had provided the island's best record of settlement activity from the 5th and 6th centuries to the 13th and 14th centuries. He edited the new book, A Late Iron Age farmstead in the Outer Hebrides: Excavations at Mound 1, Bornais, South Uist. Prof Sharples said the large sizes of the area's settlements, and the quality of the finds recovered, suggested that people of significance had lived there. He said: \"From the late Iron Age there are the remains of what is called a wheelhouse. \"This is not uncommon, but what is interesting is the house burned down and a new home was built over the top of the collapsed roof, preserving the carbonised roof timbers and items on the floor beneath it.\" The relics from this house included a decorated animal bone called an astragalus and a bone dice which had been pushed into the floor of the rebuilt house. Prof Sharples said: \"These bones are thought to have been used in gaming and the dice is marked with numbers one, four, six and three. \"But they may also have been used in trying to predict the future. \"After the fire, they may have been used to help the occupiers to decide whether the fire was a bad omen, or if the house's future was safe.\" Cattle bones found decorating the hearth in the rebuilt house may suggest the residents later went on to host a large feast to celebrate the rebuilding. Prof Sharples said: \"Between seven and 12 cattle would have been needed to provide the foot bones used, suggesting whoever occupied the house could afford to lose that number of livestock.\" The Vikings later occupied Bornais, on a site a little distance away from where the Iron Age dwellers had lived in the 5th and 6th centuries. Clues that a Norse of high status lived in the later settlement include a piece of green marble thought to have been quarried on a Greek island. The same marble was used as building stone in Rome. Prof Sharples said the fragment from Bornais was shaped as a slab and possibly brought as a Christian relic from Rome. He added: \"Bornais is the largest Viking settlement known in Scotland, certainly outside of the towns, and someone very important in the hierarchy of the Kingdom of Man and Isles is likely to have lived here.\""}

And it killed about one in three of those infected. It was officially declared to have been eradicated in 1980 - the first infectious disease to have been fought on a global scale. 'Changed the world for the better' The World Health Organization appointed Henderson, known as D.A, to lead its drive to stamp out the disease in 1966. At the time it was still endemic in Africa and Asia. Few gave him much chance of success.

Actions that weaken international results must be avoided. \"We urge the US to reconsider its announced decision.\" German Health Minister Jens Spahn described the setback as \"disappointing\" although he accepted the WHO \"needs reform\". \"The EU must take a leading role and engage more financially,\" he said. A spokesperson for the UK said: \"Coronavirus is a global challenge and the World Health Organization has an important role to play in leading the international health response. We have no plans to withdraw our funding.\" The chair of the US Senate Health Committee, Lamar Alexander, said the move could hamper the discovery of a vaccine against Covid-19 and urged a reversal of the decision in the \"strongest terms possible\". \"Certainly there needs to be a good, hard look at mistakes the World Health Organization might have made in connection with coronavirus, but the time to do that is after the crisis has been dealt with, not in the middle of it,\" he said. Ex-presidential candidate and US Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted: \"President Trump's decision to leave the @WHO during a global pandemic alienates our allies, undermines our global leadership, and threatens the health of the American people.\" Anders Nordstrom, a former WHO acting director general, said he was \"deeply concerned\" the move would increase political tension at a time when \"we need to have global solidarity\". South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize called the decision \"unfortunate\". WHO member states agreed on 19 May to set up an independent inquiry into the global response to the pandemic. What was behind Trump's decision? Speaking at the White House, Mr Trump said: \"Because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms, we will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs.\" It is not clear when any US withdrawal might take place. A 1948 agreement between the US and WHO allows for one year's notice before pulling out. Mr Trump has accused China of trying to cover up the outbreak of coronavirus, which occurred in the city of Wuhan late last year. He also says that \"China has total control over the World Health Organization\". The president accused China of pressurising the WHO to \"mislead the world\" about the virus, without elaborating. \"The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government,\" he said. The US will redirect its funds for the WHO to other health groups. More than 102,000 people in the US have lost their lives to Covid-19 - by far the biggest death toll in the world. Opponents say Mr Trump is trying to deflect criticism of his handling of the pandemic ahead of his re-election bid this year. Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has said that Mr Trump is trying to mislead the public, smear China and \"shift the blame for [the US's] own incompetent response\". What is the WHO - and who funds it?"}

Although United Russia looks likely to win again in parliamentary elections on Sunday, there is growing dissatisfaction in the country. Over the past few years, people have seen bureaucrats and politicians buying mansions and luxury cars, way beyond anything their official salaries could pay for. The word \"korruptsiya\" (corruption) is on the lips of businessmen and pensioners - and even Kremlin spin-doctors. Contrasting cases The most infamous recent case of alleged corruption centres on the death of Sergei Magnitsky. He was a young corporate lawyer working on behalf of Hermitage Capital, a British investment fund specialising in Russia. Sergei Magnitsky discovered what he thought was a massive tax fraud. He believed that officials had wrongly awarded a $230m (£145m) tax refund, which had ended up in criminal hands. But the bureaucrats and policemen he accused turned the tables on him. He was arrested, and a year later he died in prison after a severe beating and months of medical neglect. His fate contrasts with that of Olga Stepanova, the woman who authorised the tax refund. She is one of a group of officials who suddenly became very rich. Her mother-in-law is now the registered owner of an ultra-modern country house outside Moscow worth an estimated $20m, and her husband owns luxury villas in Montenegro and Dubai. She says the money came from her husband's business, but their annual joint tax returns show an income of around $38,000. 'No conscience' It is two years since Sergei Magnitsky died, but none of those he accused of the tax fraud has been brought to justice. \"It's terrible. I don't know how these people live with themselves,\" his mother Natalya Magnitskaya said. \"They have no conscience. And I find it very difficult to come to terms with that.\" For many observers the case of Sergei Magnitsky has come to symbolise much of what is wrong with modern Russia. It exemplifies a system which seems to allow some officials to become very rich without any comeback. The era of the oligarchs was the 1990s; this is the age of the millionaire Russian bureaucrat. Drive along Rublyovo-Uspyenskoye Shosse into the countryside to the west of Moscow, and the scale of the enrichment of officials becomes clear. It looks like the sort of place where only millionaires would live, but here Russia's new rich reside - the ministers and officials. Some of the money comes from legitimate businesses. But much comes from bribes, from government contracts given to friends and relatives, and from seats on boards with a clear conflict of interest. Giorgy Dzagurov is the owner of Penny Lane Realty, one of Moscow's biggest real estate agents. \"I would say that 40% to 60% of buyers of top-end housing in Russia are Russian governmental employees,\" he said. \"That does not necessarily mean it comes from corruption, but some properties are directly purchased from bribes.\" The mansions on the Nikolino Elite Settlement are worth $20m or more, but among the residents is Boris Gromov, the governor of the Moscow Region. He owns no businesses, and the only jobs he has ever done are soldier and politician. His official salary is around $125,000. Car audit Then there are the luxury cars. Gennady Gudkov, who is a member of opposition party Just Russia in parliament, carried out an investigation into expensive cars being bought with state funds. He found that even small departments and universities were buying top-of-the-range Audis, BMWs and Mercedes Benzes. \"Our bureaucrats did not save any money. They spent a lot just for their luxury. Just for their pleasure. Taking no attention to the needs of the people, of common people,\" he complained. \"They do what they want, paying no attention to the needs of common people. That's the result of a lack of control and impunity. \"It's very dangerous when people start to hate those who must serve them. They see them using these luxury cars when salaries go down, and all other benefits go down.\" In most democracies it is the parliament that gives the population an official voice, providing a check on the executive. But Russia's parliament, the Duma, has had its wings badly clipped during the Putin years. Charade At a recent debate on corruption none of the deputies appeared to be listening to the speeches. The voting was a bizarre charade in which deputies ran around pressing the voting buttons on behalf of absent colleagues - even the parliamentary procedures were a fraud. Vladimir Pligin is one of the better-respected members of the ruling United Russia party. He says he knows the problems but asks people to be patient \"We have not achieved the proper balance between the executive, legislative power and also our court system. We are in the process of the construction of this balance,\" he explained. He said that the process had been going on for \"only 20 years - not a big period of time from the historical point of view\". The problem is that the system of corruption is becoming entrenched. By the time democratic reform comes along, the patience of the people of Russia may have run out."}

Care homes in the northern, southern and western trust areas were earmarked for closure in April. In May, the health minister ordered trusts to suspend consultation plans. The move followed a public outcry, with families and residents angry about how the matter was being handled. Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Poots said it would be a time for people to come first, not buildings. \"I welcome the fact that that is how things are going to be done in the future,\" he said. \"It doesn't mean that residential care homes won't close in some locations across Northern Ireland. \"What it does mean is that each person will be treated as an individual, that their views will be listened to, they'll be respected and that will be core to this, that this will be about the individual not about the facility.\" The health union, Unison, said while residential homes failed to accept any long-term residents, within five years there would not be enough people to justify keeping them open. In October, the health board is to consult about what criteria should be used to assess a home's future. The director of Social Care and Children, Fionnuala McAndrew, said the process would be more transparent. \"Nobody would be saying that older people will be forced to leave their home,\" she said. \"Our experience is that when you work with families, you show people alternatives. \"We take our time to ensure that people are satisfied and ready for the change, that that can be done successfully.\" Any major changes, including proposed closures, will require a second consultation. While this time the board's response is more measured, the BBC understands its intention remains the same - to eventually close most of Northern Ireland's care homes. That means more homes are likely to close in the next three to five years than remain open. In May, the commissioner for older people criticised the lack of consultation with residents in NHS residential care homes facing closure. Claire Keatinge described the anguish expressed in the media and to her office by elderly residents and their families as \"very serious\". \"The Health and Social Care Board, I understand they did give a commitment that nobody will be forced to leave a statutory residential care home,\" she said. \"They need to stand over that and they need to show people what the alternatives are if a home is closing, they need to show that the alternative is better. \"The people in care homes need to be absolutely sure that they understand what their choices are and if their choice is to remain in the care home, they need to be able to express that clearly.\""}

Speaking in an interview with the Radio Times magazine, he said: \"You should apologise for things that you have done, that you recognise that perhaps you shouldn't have done or regret,\" he said. \"Apologising for things that your great, great, great, great-grandfather or grandmother did, seems to me a complete exercise in moral vacuousness,\" he said. However, Michael Blanch, chairman of the Committee for the Commemoration of the Irish Famine Victims, said Mr Paxman was in \"denial\" if he thought an apology was not appropriate. He said he should apologise for his remarks. \"If Mr Paxman was making similar comments in certain European countries denying what happened during World War II, he would be incarcerated,\" he said. \"This is not about individuals. As a state and as a government at the time of the famine, there was wrong and there was neglect. An apology was long overdue.\" Mr Blanch said healing and reconciliation was going on in Northern Ireland and it was wrong to \"annexe\" one part of history, like the famine, and suggest it did not matter. In 1997, Mr Blair made a statement on the 150th anniversary of the famine. He described it as \"a defining event in the history of Ireland and of Britain\". \"It has left deep scars.

But with the fund reaching capacity, and live music a distant prospect, other applicants may be left stranded. \"It's a bigger, longer crisis than any of us could have thought possible,\" said the charity's chief executive, James Ainscough. Touring and gigging musicians have been particularly affected by the lockdown, as months of work simply vanished in mid-March. Many of them (up to 25%) are not covered by the government's scheme to support freelancers, and have no other source of income during the lockdown. 'It's really grisly' The current Help Musicians fund is targeted at those self-employed workers, following a first phase in March that offered one-off grants of £500 to any musician facing immediate financial difficulties. That scheme handed out over £8m to nearly 17,000 musicians in just four weeks, including The Waterboys' drummer Ralph Salmins. \"My work is not coming back till March or April next year,\" he told the BBC. \"I don't know what I'm going to do.\" The musician, who has performed or recorded with Paul McCartney, Bjork, Aretha Franklin and Madonna, as well as appearing on more than 150 film soundtracks, said the industry could be facing \"a two-year lull\" before returning to normal. \"We're really, really in a corner in the arts and I don't think, unfortunately, the government has quite cottoned on to it,\" he said. \"It's really grisly. It's very, very dire.\" A study conducted by Help Musicians found that 99% of musicians had worried about their financial situation during lockdown, while 46% said the impact on their wellbeing had been \"strong or severe\". \"One of the points for us, is that financial hardship funding isn't just about financial hardship,\" Mr Ainscough explained. \"It's actually about reducing anxiety, which reduces the likelihood of tripping into more serious mental health issues. \"It's about stopping someone becoming homeless, stopping somebody from having to go couch-surfing, and keeping them in a state where actually they've got a hope of remaining creative.\" He added that, while most people think of musicians as being Stormzy or Dua Lipa, the vast majority live a much more meagre existence. \"After the first round of grants, one lady wrote back to me and said, 'I've never been more excited to pay my rent,'\" Mr Ainscough recalled. 'Buoyed up' Help Musicians, along with the Musicians Union, is calling on the government to provide extra help to freelancers in the arts who are suffering financial difficulties. \"This is a much longer-term problem than for other sectors of the economy, which can open up now,\" said Mr Ainscough. In response, a government spokesman said: \"We recognise these are challenging times for the UK's world-class music industry and are providing unprecedented support for artists through substantial government financial measures, including loans and guarantees as well as support for the self-employed. \"On top of this they can also benefit from the £160 million package of emergency funding from Arts Council England. We've also changed the welfare system so that self-employed people can now access Universal Credit in full to help people get faster and more generous support when they need it most.\" In the meantime, Help Musicians is seeking donations to top up its emergency fund - which was initially drawn from its own reserves, combined with £500,000 from music rights organisation PPL and £50,000 from Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol. Another supporter is Squeeze's Chris Difford, who held an online fund-raiser for the charity last week. \"I got involved because a friend of mine, who suffers from depression, is a fabulous writer and found themselves without any money and without anywhere to go. \"He turned to Help Musicians and he got a grant, and he was really buoyed up by the support,\" he told the BBC. \"So I was impressed by what I saw.\" Difford, whose hits include Tempted, Up The Junction and Cool For Cats, added that, like many musicians, touring had been his main source of income for the past 15 years - but he couldn't see concerts resuming soon. \"I'd love live music to come back as soon as possible but I just don't know where the confidence is going to come from,\" he said. \"If somebody said to me, 'You've got an American tour in three months' time,' I would definitely have to sort of take a very deep breath about it and think it through.\" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Adebowale was removed from Broadmoor last week following a deterioration in his condition after he contracted Covid-19. The 29-year-old is not in intensive care or on a ventilator. The Sun reported Adebowale tested positive for coronavirus a fortnight ago. Adebowale, who now uses the name Ismaail Kuti, and his fellow killer Michael Adebolajo, 36, drove into Fusilier Rigby with a car before hacking him to death near Woolwich Barracks in 2013. Fusilier Rigby died as a result of multiple cut and stab wounds following the attack fuelled by Adebowale and Adebolajo's extremist beliefs. The killing was described as a \"betrayal of Islam\" at their murder trial in 2014. Adebolajo had claimed he was a \"soldier of Allah\" and the killing was an act of war. In a police interview Adebolajo said he and Adebowale decided to lie in wait near the barracks and targeted Fusilier Rigby because he was wearing a Help for Heroes hooded top and carrying a camouflage rucksack. Adebolajo then gave a witness a handwritten letter containing a speech about fighting \"Allah's enemies\" and bringing \"carnage\" to London's streets.

The Latitude Festival has grown to become a key date on the calendar of music fans since it started in 2006. For Rebecca Bishop, director of the Two Magpies Bakery, in Darsham, it is typically a \"crazy\" weekend. \"It starts earlier in the week when the crews start arriving and then, by Wednesday and Thursday, we have a massive line of traffic outside the bakery,\" Ms Bishop said. \"It's all systems go, we're making hundreds and hundreds of croissants.\" General manager Yasmin Wyatt said staff have to plan their journey into work on the Latitude weekend to avoid being delayed. Last year, she made an error and \"completely forgot the build-up to the festival\". \"I got stuck in the A12 festival traffic and genuinely a half-hour trip to get to work ended up taking two hours and 45 minutes,\" she said. This year, there are no such problems. The festival was cancelled weeks ago. Another popular haunt for festival staff before and after the event would normally be The White Hart, the nearby pub and bed and breakfast in Blythburgh. Landlord Lee Knight said for them \"it starts about a month before\". \"We get the production crew coming in and then you get more of them and all the organisers,\" he said. \"For the five days [Latitude] is on we're really quiet. Then two weeks after we get another 40 people come in to pack down. So before and after it's very busy for us.\" Mr Knight, 42, said that while locals were \"sad\" the event had been cancelled, the impact on businesses is \"not about that weekend, it's the whole three months\" of lockdown. About 14 miles (22km) from the site is Lowestoft-based Atlas Taxis, which has been running for about 30 years. Sue Harvey said the cancellation left a \"big void\" in what would normally be the start of the summer season for the firm. You might also like: Over the years, it has benefited as Latitude has grown to attract 40,000 people, including festival staff and guests. \"It's a major event for all the taxi firms, not just ourselves.

Normally, the company's entire fleet of 25 vehicles would be out each day of the Latitude weekend - compared to about 15 on a usual weekend evening - taking people between Lowestoft and Henham Park. The festival has been hosted in the 4,200-acre Henham Park since its inception in 2006, land that has been in the Rous family for the past 500 years. Current owner Hektor Rous said he would usually be preparing to go down to the site and open up the gates for the first day, but instead was \"enjoying the sunshine and out with the kids\" at the bakery. He said while it was \"really sad\" the festival was not taking place, \"people have bigger problems going on than this\". \"Of course, on Saturday I'll be sitting on the bridge with a beer thinking 'where are the other 40,000 people?', but it's not the end of the world. We'll be back bigger and better next year.\" Mr Rous said he felt for the B&Bs, holiday lets and restaurants in the area. \"People come here for the festival and they say 'you know what I might come back here in August for a holiday', it helps people discover Suffolk and that's always been fantastic,\" he said. But he added that businesses would \"bounce back\". \"Suffolk people are strong, able and clever and we'll all be good next year. \"The whole planet is probably looking forward to some kind of good party and definitely Suffolk is, and this is the place to have it. \" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

And in late October, ecologists' fears were realised when an important barrier was breached - it was found in the wider environment and the UK's 80 million ash trees were at risk. The news last month that the disease, caused by the fungus Chalara fraxinea, had been found in woodlands in East Anglia prompted Mr Paterson to impose an import ban on ash trees, and to carry out a nationwide survey to find out how far the disease had spread. He also convened an emergency summit, bringing together \"key stakeholders\", to consider what could be done. The resulting action plan, agreed at an emergency Cobra meeting, outlined where the government would focus its efforts. The plan seems to be pinning a great deal of hope on scientists finding natural resistance within the UK's population of ash trees. Once identified, researchers would then look to grow the next generation of ash trees that would be resilient to the pathogen. One of the government's leading scientists, Prof Ian Boyd, is optimistic. He told journalists: \"By next season, we could potentially have resistant forms of ash growing in this country.\" Mind the gap But ash trees, while considered fast-growing within the world of hardwood trees, take decades to reach maturity and produce the seeds that would sow naturally resistant trees. In the interim, ash dieback will continue to spread and trees would continue to become infected and not be replaced, as Dr Pocock explained. How ash dieback could threaten Britain's wildlife \"Those that are susceptible to the disease will get hit, and those that are not or less susceptible will go on and will be able to fruit. That is the process of natural selection,\" he told BBC News. \"But the process of natural selection on trees will operate on much longer timescales. \"If there was a disease that affected an annual plant, the selection pressure on that plant would be such that you would get resistance, and then you would get the spread of the resistant [offspring of the plant]. \"You would see a dip in that species population for a couple of years, and then it would be likely to recover,\" Dr Pocock explained. \"You would expect to see the same thing in trees, but the timescale is at least decades rather than months or years.\" So would ecosystems be able to cope with the loss of ash trees from the landscape while the naturally resistant trees matured? RSPB forestry officer Nick Phillips said UK woodlands were already in trouble. \"The important point to remember here is that woodland wildlife is already in crisis,\" he told BBC News. \"One in six woodland flowers is threatened with extinction. Our woodland butterflies have halved since the 1990s. Many of our woodland birds have declined by 70% or more. \"This is not the result of tree disease, this is something that has already been going on for some time. \"Our woodland wildlife is already stressed and we don't know yet what effect additional stress will have on it.\" Mission impossible And the outbreak is already shaping the future, as tree managers weigh up the risk of planting ash in woodlands. This year saw the Woodland Trust create 59 Diamond Woods and its flagship 460-acre (186ha) Diamond Park in Leicestershire to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. A spokesman told BBC News that, in light of the news that the disease was here to stay, the Trust had taken the decision that it would suspend planting ash saplings and substitute them with other native species. He added that now that the planting season was opening, there were plans to plant three million trees over the coming months. \"As it stands, we are running all tree planting events as normal. We will substitute any ash saplings for either oak, birch or possible shrubs such as hazel, dependent on the location and what fits best within the current landscape.\" And the concern about planting new ash trees is spreading. Brighton is famed for being home to veteran elms that did not fall victim to the outbreak of Dutch elm disease, thanks to the combination of the city's geographical location and a very robust tree management regime. However, a spokeswoman for Brighton and Hove Council said such an approach would not work to prevent ash dieback infecting trees. \"The recent outbreak of ash dieback is spread by the wind, and this type of dispersal is impossible to protect against. \"At present, we are not purchasing any ash trees and would avoid the species until we know more about the disease.\" So until scientists make a breakthrough and can propagate ash dieback-resistant trees, the situation for ash - a popular street tree - is likely to get worse before it gets better. Ash is one of just 30-odd native tree species, making the thought of losing it from the landscape a difficult pill to swallow for many people. \"It is very difficult to predict what the impact will be if ash dieback is as serious as the worst fears,\" Centre for Ecology and Hydrology ecologist Michael Pocock observed. \"The vast majority if not all ecologists will be [recording the spread and impact of the disease] with a heavy heart because, ultimately, we are not ecologists to chart the progress of doom - we are ecologists because we care about the environment and we want to do something positive.\""}

It was built in 1797 and before it was expanded into a hotel it was the home of Capt Frank Barnwell, chief designer at the Bristol Aeroplane Company. The owner said it was \"not suitable\" for conversion and would be knocked down if the flats plans were approved. Marion Reeve, who organised a petition to save the building, said she was \"disappointed\" the hotel might disappear. \"It's a beautiful hotel, it's a Georgian design,\" she said. \"It's been a highlight at the entrance of the historic town of Alveston and Thornbury for all these years. It's a landmark.\" 'So forgotten' The building houses a blue plaque in memory of Capt Barnwell, who also built and flew the first aircraft in Scotland in 1910. Ms Reeve said it was important to preserve the memory of \"one of the very first aviators in the British Isles\". \"He's so forgotten. All his sons have died so they can't pass on his memory.\" A previous plan to demolish the building to make way for 34 apartments was refused earlier this year. Owner, David Cahill, said a revised planning application was due to be submitted to South Gloucestershire Council \"in the next three weeks\". \"It will have to be knocked down as part of this application,\" he added. The building has also been used in the past as a school for children with learning disabilities and an academy for soldiers. A council spokesman said because the building was not listed or in a conservation area no planning permission was required to knock it down."}

He apologised, saying the council's response to reports of abuse dating back to the 1960s was \"unforgiveable\". But a solicitor for the victims said it was \"shocking\" that it had taken so long for an apology from the council. Mr Rumbelow said the council was working to safeguard young people and assisting the national Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA). Richard Scorer, a solicitor for some of the the victims, claimed the independent inquiry which opens on 9 October and will examine abuse allegations about Cambridge House and Knowl View, is the real reason for the apology. Analysis: Jonathan Ali, BBC Radio Manchester This apology relates to two places, Cambridge House Boys hostel and Knowl View residential school, which were both based in Rochdale. Boys were placed at Cambridge House in the mid 1960s and it is alleged they were abused by the former MP Cyril Smith in the hostel. In 2016 the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case. Knowl View opened in 1969 but almost from day one it is alleged abuse took place on a regular basis in the late 80s and early 90s. It is claimed concerns were raised by health professionals about allegations of sexual abuse within the school and also outside. Despite a major police inquiry, only two men have ever been convicted of crimes at the school. The apology by Steve Rumbelow comes before the IICSA hears evidence about Rochdale for three weeks beginning 9 October. Mr Scorer said: \"The council has recognised that when the evidence comes out in the hearing, they are likely to be heavily criticised and I think that is what's driving this apology.\" He added: \"I think it is absolutely shocking that it has taken so long for this apology to come.\" 'Reparations to survivors' Peter Forbes, who said he was a victim of sexual abuse while at Knowl View, agreed. \"[The authority] should have done that originally when the initial cases came out... they should have said 'we are sorry for what happened to those young people whilst in our care'... and make reparations to myself and fellow survivors.\" More than 40 men recently alleged they were victims of abuse at Knowl View, and Cambridge House with 24 alleging they were abused between 1960 and 1994 by Rochdale's former Liberal MP Cyril Smith who was a governor at Knowl View. He died in 2010. In October prosecutors said no action will be taken into fresh allegations of abuse there; a decision dubbed \"shameful\" by Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Lloyd."}

The deal, which will backdate pay for staff with lower incomes, will add £2.3m to the council's wage bill. Union members will vote in September on whether to accept the deal. It also pledges to honour nationally-agreed rises locally, from April 2013. The lowest paid staff will be the first to have their pay restored from 1 November. Staff earning more than £35,000 will receive no immediate increase in pay and an employee suggestion scheme has been proposed to help find a further £500,000 in savings that will enable the authority to restore the pay of the top earners. Revised plans In February 2011, councillors finalised budget cuts of £25m and said all workers earning more than £17,500, which is 65% of staff, would have their pay cut through reduced working hours. It later revised the plans so those earning more than £22,000 would lose up to 5% of their pay. Thousands of staff, including refuse collectors and social care staff, went on strike the following month, beginning months of industrial action which continued into the autumn. Unions also initiated legal proceedings against the council, which they claimed was acting illegally by failing to consult both on the new contracts and on redundancies. The legal action was suspended following Thursday's announcement. Labour won control of the council in May 2012."}

The Conservative-run council wants to sell the £2m statue citing high insurance and security costs. Asked for a response, the council will only say it \"is in discussion about the statue's sale\". The opposition Liberal Democrat group said the council had failed to keep it up to date on the sale. Group leader Brendan Glynane said he would ask what the council meant by \"discussions\" and would seek more clarity on the sale at the next council meeting. 'No right to sell' The ruling party had earlier said it could not comment during talks with the legal advisers of the present Marquis of Northampton, but \"will issue updates when appropriate\". The sale has been challenged by Lord Northampton, who said the council did not have the right to sell the statue under the original deed of gift. The 30in (76cm) limestone figure clutching beer, bread and cake - items for the afterlife - is believed to have been acquired by Spencer Compton, the second Marquis of Northampton during a trip to Egypt in 1850. It was presented to the museum by his son. The council said the statue's value made it too expensive to insure and secure, and the money raised from its sale could benefit other local heritage and cultural projects."}

Do you really want to invite personal questions like that? Maybe it's better to not say anything about your sexuality at all'.\" 'Not hiding any more' But he added: \"I ignored her advice. \"When a journalist did ask me about my sexuality, I said 'Yes, I'm gay and this song is about a man'. \"I needed to say that for my 15-year old self. I needed to say to him, 'Look, we are not hiding any more'.\" The 27-year-old also talked about how he had struggled with anxiety and depression in his youth, because he had grown up \"in a society that taught me I had to behave in a certain way and that being gay was not normal\". He later made a BBC documentary about his experiences, called Growing Up Gay, and said that speaking candidly about homosexuality had helped him combat his anxiety. The response took him by surprise. \"I got so many messages from fans who wanted to share their story, who were struggling with their sexuality or gender identity, had problems at school or at home,\" he said. \"I was honestly quite shocked at the extent of pain people were struggling with. I felt like I was hearing an alarm bell ringing. A cry for help that was largely going ignored. \"That is why I continue to speak out. We have to listen and learn from each other to lift each other up, so we can all live the life we deserve.\" Alexander's emotional speech earned a standing ovation from the audience, which included host June Sarpong, author and trans activist Juno Dawson, swimmer Mark Foster, and TV personalities Gok Wan and Gaby Roslin. Little Mix star Jade Thirlwall, who used her 25th birthday party in December to raise money for Stonewall, was also in attendance. The gala dinner, in London, was held to mark the 30th anniversary of the introduction of Section 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act.

His parents, Nick and Jane Lawton, are urging the Government to change the law, which says 17 year-olds are not children in custody. The Home Office believes current laws are adequate. Joe was arrested when police stopped him as he drove his new car home from a party last August.

The idea has been rejected by the UK government under current plans to devolve financial powers to Wales. However, the four main parties in Wales have called for it to be reconsidered. Bristol Airport chief executive Robert Sinclair claimed any power to cut or abolish the duty would be unfair. The duty imposes a £13 charge on every passenger flying from the UK on short flights, rising to £97 for the most distant long-haul destinations, with the amounts doubled on tickets in business class. The idea of devolving the duty - recommended by the cross-party Silk Commission - was not included in the Wales Bill currently making its way through Parliament. But Cardiff Airport chairman Lord Rowe-Beddoe tabled an amendment to the bill in the House of Lords last week calling for the devolution of air passenger duty on all flights. 'Selective subsidies' Mr Sinclair said he was concerned Cardiff Airport would have an unfair advantage if the Welsh government was given the opportunity to cut or abolish the duty, resulting in cheaper flights. \"The argument that Bristol Airport and Cardiff Airport do not compete is disingenuous,\" he said. \"The two airports are less than 100km apart. Bristol is as convenient as Cardiff for many people who live in south east Wales, and we currently serve 25% of the market for air travel for the entire country. \"This is not about England versus Wales, it is about the market deciding where airlines wish to operate and passengers voting with their feet. \"Selective subsidies or tax systems which favour one government-owned airport over privately operated competitors are not only unfair, they are a waste of taxpayers' money.\" Bristol's elected mayor George Ferguson has told BBC Wales that Cardiff and Bristol should avoid competing in every area in favour of working together as a Severn region, fighting competition from cities in northern England for investment. Mr Sinclair's comments came as provisional figures showed a 7% drop in year-on-year passenger numbers in September at Cardiff Airport, following an 8% fall in August. The airport's managing director, Debra Barber, said the \"slight dip\" in passengers was expected because of \"airline fleet changes, which are not unusual in the industry\". The Conservatives said the airport, bought by the Welsh government last year, would be better off outside the state sector. Shadow transport minister in the assembly Byron Davies said: \"The sooner Cardiff Airport is returned to private ownership, to encourage private sector investment to help ensure its future, the better.\""}

The Chang'e-5 mission is China's third successful Moon landing in seven years. Ms Zhou was in charge of the rocket connector system - described as a pivotal role. The young astronaut has been a trending topic on Weibo since Chinese state media highlighted her as one of the women involved in the successful launch of the Chang'e-5 lunar probe on 23 November. Her story in particular has resonated with the public given her young age. Social media users have been celebrating her \"brilliance\" and referring to her as a \"source of pride\" for the country. Several people jokingly reflected on their own achievements, commenting how far behind in life they were in comparison. The huge amount of interest in the Guizhou Province native has not appeared to have had much of an effect on her, however. According to news site Duocai Guizhou Net, Ms Zhou declined repeated requests for interviews as she does not wish to let fame get in the way of her work. The aim of the Chang'e-5 - named after the Chinese moon goddess - is to gather lunar rocks and soil to help scientists learn more about the moon's formations. If successful, it would be the first in more than 40 years to bring lunar samples back to Earth, and will make China the third country to do so after the United States and the Soviet Union. The mission is part of Beijing's push to become a space superpower, with the Chinese state media casting the \"space dream\" - as President Xi Jinping calls it - as one step in the path to \"national rejuvenation\". For China, space exploration is seen as a way to display its growing technological might, as well as to demonstrate itself as a force to be reckoned with on the world stage. Prof Ouyang Ziyuan, one of the country's top scientists, told China's official newspaper People's Daily back in 2006: \"Lunar exploration is a reflection of a country's comprehensive national power.\" Last year, China became the first country to successfully land a robotic spacecraft on the far side of the moon. In the next few decades, it plans to build a research station on the Moon and send people to Mars. Kerry Allen, China Media Analyst Most Chinese know the story of the mythological Chang'e, the Chinese goddess of the moon. It's a story not dissimilar to Romeo & Juliet - about a woman who drinks an immortality potion, accidentally leaving none for her husband, and weightlessly, flying to the moon so she can stay close to him until he dies. It is told every year during China's Mid-Autumn/Moon Festival, and so people can't hear the word \"Chang'e\" without conjuring up romantic images of a moon goddess. For this reason, China's mission to the moon was calling out for a strong female figure. And so pictures of 24-year-old Zhou Chengyu have been all over state media, with comments about how she is a \"frontline soldier in the field of aerospace\" and a \"big sister\" that young Chinese can look up to. China has been increasingly trying to highlight strong female figures in the country. The country's top leadership is extremely male-dominated, but in November, national newspaper Global Times invited netizens to comment on the year's achievements by women like medical scientist Chen Wei, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, and UFC fighter Zhang Weili. But many in China feel that the role of women in the country is still underplayed, in many industries. This was a big talking point in September, when a TV drama highlighting women's roles in China's Covid-19 fight was widely viewed as sexist."}

Chief Constable Suzette Davenport, lead officer for roads policing, said forces were using different approaches. Last year, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said motorists caught using mobiles could face tougher punishments. Figures from a Freedom of Information Act request by BBC Radio 5 live show 72,753 fixed penalty notices (FPN) were given out in 2014. Information was requested from the 43 police forces in England and Wales, plus British Transport Police - and 36 provided it. In 2013, 95,941 FPNs were given out for mobile phone offences, while 122,752 were given out in 2010 by the same forces. One force, Staffordshire Police, issued just four fixed penalty notices for mobile phone use last year. The force said it had developed its own programme to deal with motorists - a four-hour \"crash course\" run by police, fire and victim support officials. By comparison, the Metropolitan Police issued the most FPNs - 22,729 - last year, while Thames Valley Police issued 10,579 - the second highest. Drivers caught using mobile phones at the wheel can be given a fixed penalty notice - which means three penalty points on their licence and a £100 fine. In July last year, Mr McLoughlin said the penalty for motorists could be doubled to six points. However, figures suggest many police forces have offered first-time offenders the chance to attend a road safety course, similar to those devised to deter speeding. 'Crash course' More than 99,000 people attended the What's Driving Us? course in 2014 - a 53% increase on the previous year. The course is aimed at motorists found to be intentionally breaking the law, including those caught using mobiles. A spokesman for road safety charity Brake said FPN figures could indicate a \"decline in policing resources\". \"We need traffic policing to be made a national priority, so police have the resources to catch and penalise risky multi-tasking drivers, as well as much higher fines to truly deter phone use by drivers,\" he said. Jayne Willetts, roads policing lead for the Police Federation of England and Wales, also said the decrease could have been caused by a \"substantial reduction\" in office numbers. Paul Newman, whose sister Ellen died after being hit by a driver using his mobile, said tougher punishments were needed - but warned even that might not be enough to deter drivers. \"All the penalty points in the world, it's not going to go away. All the education in the world, it's not going to go away,\" he said. \"I'm scared the figures will make people think they've conquered this - we really haven't.\" Mr Newman added that he thinks it's a \"dangerous message\" to send out, saying: \"It's a confusing message and we've a long way to go.\" Jane Allen's 29-year-old son Shaun Worthington died in a car crash moments after sending a text while driving back from a safety awareness course last November. She said: \"This use of mobile phone while driving - it's not right. It's certainly not safe. It's not safe for you, it's not safe for other people that are on the road. \"Anybody can be wiped out in the blink of an eye. My son has paid the ultimate price with his life. If this can happen to my son, it can happen to anybody out there who is using a mobile phone.\" Ms Davenport, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead on roads policing, said forces had \"a number of options\" when dealing with motorists using their phones when driving. \"If you are caught doing so, forces will choose what they believe to be the right enforcement action to deter you from doing so again,\" she said."}

The referendum passed off peacefully across the three provinces that make up the region, and in areas controlled by Kurdish forces but claimed by Baghdad. Turnout was estimated at about 72%, according to the electoral commission. Partial unofficial results published by the Kurdish Rudaw website show that more than 90% have voted for independence. There were scenes of celebration as the polls closed in the regional capital, Irbil, and in the disputed city of Kirkuk, where a curfew was imposed on Monday night amid fears of unrest. \"It's a day of celebration today.

There was some opposition to the vote among non-Kurdish populations in disputed areas between the Kurdish and Iraqi governments. In Kirkuk, the local ethnic Arab and Turkmen communities had called for a boycott The vote is being closely watched not only in Iraq but elsewhere in the region because its implications could reshape the Middle East, the BBC's Orla Guerin in Irbil reports. Turkey and Iran fear the impact this could have on their own Kurdish communities, our correspondent adds. In Istanbul, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described the vote as \"unacceptable\" and threatened to close the Iraqi Kurds' vital oil export pipeline. \"We have the tap. The moment we close the tap, then it's done,\" he was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. He also said his country could close completely the sole border crossing with the region. Traffic there, he said, was currently only being allowed to cross from the Turkish side. Late on Monday, Iraqi and Turkish officials announced they would hold joint military drills in Turkey in an area bordering the Kurdish region of Iraq. Iran called the vote \"illegal\", having banned all flights to and from the Kurdish region a day earlier. UN Secretary General António Guterres expressed concern about the \"potentially destabilising effects\" of the vote. The referendum What is at stake?

The BBC's business editor Kamal Ahmed says that internally, Tesco has admitted the fall in sales is its worst performance for 20 years. Tesco has faced intense competition from discount rivals including Aldi and Lidl as well as from more upmarket retailers such as Waitrose. Industry figures continue to show the UK's largest supermarket suffering a decline in its share of the grocery market. On Tuesday, data from grocery market analysts Kantar Worldpanel showed Tesco's market share declined to 29% in the three months to 25 May from 30.5% a year earlier, while sales fell 3.1%. Tesco, along with Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury's, has responded to the threat from discount grocers by lowering prices on essential items including bread, milk and eggs. Tesco said sales volumes of these essentials had risen 28% in the quarter. It has also launched a programme of store revamps, which will see 650 stores across the UK upgraded in the next year. Revival Mr Clarke said: \"Our accelerated plans are making a real difference for customers and we are more competitive than we have been for many years.\" But he warned that sales were set to continue to suffer. Mr Clarke added: \"We are pleased by the early response to our accelerated efforts to deliver the most compelling offer for customers. \"We expect this acceleration to continue to impact our headline performance throughout the coming quarters and for trading conditions to remain challenging for the UK grocery market as a whole.\" Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers said investors \"would need to ponder whether Tesco is a company showing glimpses of revival given its turnaround plan, or whether it is past its sell-by date.\" He added: \"The wider ferocity of competition is making the implementation of the plan more difficult to achieve, although the company is trying to position itself within the three largest requirements of the supermarket sector at present, in the form of price, online and convenience stores.\" Shares in the supermarket were 1%, or 3.5p, higher to 300.55 in early trading on the London Stock Exchange. Tesco's international business recorded a 2.2% fall in like-for-like sales, including VAT and excluding petrol.

Borrowing costs above 6% are considered by many analysts to be unaffordable in the long run. Spain held a short-term bond auction on Tuesday at which the rate for 12-month bonds rose to 2.6% from 1.4% at the last auction in March, while 18-month bonds were up from 1.7% to 3.1%. Analysts said that Spain had passed the hurdle of this auction, but that the challenges for the economy remain. \"Until we see signs that the government is implementing the medium-term fiscal consolidation programme and signs of life in the Spanish economy, investors are going to worry about the trajectory of the debt-to-GDP ratio in the medium-term,\" said Nick Stamenkovic, bond strategist at RIA Capital Markets.

It has reached its final decision after a public consultation process. \"Competition appears not to be working effectively in the private motor insurance market,\" said OFT chief executive Clive Maxwell. \"The insurers of at-fault drivers appear to have little control over the bills they must pay, and this may be leading to higher costs for them and ultimately higher premiums for motorists.\" The OFT was particularly concerned that replacement vehicles being provided could be unnecessarily expensive and they could be being provided for longer than necessary. The regulator's report earlier in the year suggested that the market was \"dysfunctional\". It claimed that replacement car hire was on average £560 more expensive each time than it needed to be. Each repair was on average £155 more expensive as well. The insurers do this in return for a lucrative fee from the car hire firm or garage involved. The report said that such practices were pushing up total premiums by about £225m a year - potentially about £10 per policy. 'Serious concerns' The Association of British Insurers (ABI) welcomed the review. \"The OFT found what insurers have known for years - that when a customer has a crash that is their fault, their insurer has little control over the cost of the subsequent claim,\" said Nick Starling, the ABI's director of general insurance. \"Regulation of all players in the market to tackle excessive costs is needed, and we look forward to working with the Competition Commission to bring much needed reforms to the market that will, in turn, result in lower car insurance premiums for everyone.\" However, the Credit Hire Organisation (CHO), which represents car hirers, said premiums were rising owing to an increase of whiplash claims ahead of anything else. Martin Andrews, chief executive of the organisation, argued that giving at-fault drivers' insurers more control could mean they try to avoid ways of giving the not-at-fault driver a replacement car. \"We continue to have serious concerns as to the long-term impact it may have on the motoring consumer and their right to mobility after an accident that was not their fault,\" he said. The latest investigation comes after the exposure last year of the covert system of referral fees, under which insurers, in effect, stoke up claims against themselves and thus drive up premiums. They do this by selling details of their own policy holders' accidents to solicitors, who then encourage those drivers to sue for damages such as whiplash injury. The Competition Commission can choose to cover all these issues in the scope of its inquiry."}

Four suspects were shot dead, one arrested and other are being sought Xinhua said. City officials said evidence implicated militants from the western region of Xinjiang, but this was not verified. President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have sent condolences to the victims and their families. President Xi urged \"all-out efforts\" to investigate the attack. \"Severely punish in accordance with the law the violent terrorists and resolutely crack down on those who have been swollen with arrogance,\" Xinhua quoted the president as saying. Pools of blood Witnesses said that the men, who were mostly dressed in black, attacked people at random. A survivor named Yang Haifei, who was wounded in the back and chest, told Xinhua he had been buying a train ticket when the attackers rushed into the station. \"I saw a person come straight at me with a long knife and I ran away with everyone,\" he said. He added that those too slow to flee were cut down. Some who escaped were desperately looking for missing loved ones. Yang Ziqing told Xinhua she and her husband had been waiting for a train to Shanghai \"when a knife-wielding man suddenly came at them\". \"I can't find my husband, and his phone went unanswered,\" she said. Social media users in China posted pictures of the attack on the internet, but correspondents say they are being taken down. Images seen by the BBC show men and women lying on the floor in pools of blood following the attack. Kunming officials, quoted by Xinhua, later said that evidence at the scene showed it was \"a terrorist attack carried out by Xinjiang separatist forces\". Xinjiang is home to the Muslim Uighur minority group which has a long history of discord with Chinese authorities. State broadcaster CCTV said top security official Meng Jianzhu would travel to Kunming to oversee the handling of the investigation."}

Ikea has used the wireless charging standard QI, which is also supported by Samsung in its latest handset, the S6. Environmental group Friends of the Earth urged caution over the recyclability of such products. The Swedish furniture firm will sell charging covers for incompatible iPhone and Samsung models. There are currently more than 80 QI-compatible handsets and 15 QI-enabled cars on the market according to QI's backers the Wireless Power Consortium, an industry body whose members includes Belkin, Motorola, Panasonic and Sony. Multiple choice However it is not the only charging standard in development. The S6 will also be compatible with PMA, a rival wireless charger solution provided by the Power Matters Alliance, whose members include Starbucks, Duracell Powermat, Huawei and Lenovo. At the Consumer Electronics Show in January a firm called Energous demonstrated WattUp, a non-inductive system which it claims can charge gadgets that lie in a 9m (30ft) radius around the charger. Green goal Environmentalists said they hoped recycling was a priority for designers incorporating wireless charging equipment into their work. \"A key principle that manufacturers of furniture with built-in wireless charging technology should consider is that the furniture is designed to be easy to disassemble for upgrade, reuse, repair or recycling,\" Julian Kirby, resource use campaigner at Friends of the Earth, told the BBC. \"Disposable electric toothbrushes are one example of a terrible product design in those respects - it's virtually impossible to separate out the tech from the batteries and plastic casing which means valuable and often toxic materials are dumped in landfill or burnt in incinerators.\" Ikea said in a statement that its wireless charging products are \"easy to fraction at end of life\". \"By adding wireless charging to home and office furniture, we minimise the amount of separate chargers needed,\" it added. Hot stuff Additionally some existing users have reported on forums that their devices get hot while charging wirelessly. \"The wireless charging standards are evolving,\" said Ian Fogg from analysts IHS. \"The industry has no incentive to allow devices to go hot because it means the charging isn't as efficient as it might be. \"If a device gets hot, power is being lost through heat rather than being efficiently added to the battery.\" The Ikea range will go on sale in the UK and North America in April 2015, the firm said."}

Brothers Akhtar Doghar, 32, and Anjum Doghar, 31, were both given minimum terms of 17 years, at the Old Bailey. The men's offences included child rape and trafficking, between 2004 and 2012. A fifth man was also jailed for life. Kamar Jamil, 27, who was found guilty of charges including rape and arranging child prostitution, was told he would serve at least 12 years. 'Extreme depravity' Jurors heard at the men's trial at the Old Bailey how six girls, aged at the time between 11 and 15, were plied with alcohol and drugs before being forced to perform sex acts. Some were beaten and burned. The court heard how the men - two of east African origin and five of Pakistani origin - identified vulnerable girls for abuse and then groomed each one of them until they were under the control of the gang. They were then each either abused by the men themselves, given to the men's friends or offered at a price to others who were not on trial. The girls were mostly chosen because their unsettled or troubled lives made them easier to manipulate. Judge Peter Rook, sentencing, said Jamil, the Dogar brothers and the Karrar brothers abused vulnerable girls in Oxford over a long period, and on occasions the \"depravity was extreme\". The abuse started in Oxford but some victims were later taken to other parts of the country to be offered to other men who were in contact with the gang. 'Enormous courage' The court heard the victims were tied up, burnt, suffocated, beaten and urinated upon, and would return to Oxford bleeding, injured and carrying sexually-transmitted infections. Judge Rook said the men had blighted their victims' lives and robbed them of their adolescence. He said: \"These six girls have shown enormous courage in coming to the Old Bailey to give evidence, knowing they would be accused of lying, knowing they would have to relive their ordeals, knowing they have not been believed in the past.\" Judge Rook said he hoped the victims' courage would act as a deterrent to other men but also ensure the appropriate authorities would not fail in future to take action in the face of such activity. Two more men, Assad Hussain, 32, and Zeeshan Ahmed, were each jailed for seven years for two counts of sexual activity with a child. Talking about the abuse suffered by one of the victims, Judge Rook told Jamil and the Dogar brothers, who were convicted of abusing her: \"You took her soul. She felt as though it had been ripped out. You put her parents through years of sheer torture.\" In total, nine men had denied charges including rape, arranging child prostitution and trafficking between 2004 and 2012. Two were acquitted of all charges. Numerous opportunities to catch members of the gang are believed to have been missed. Thames Valley Police chief constable Sara Thornton has previously apologised for the delay in securing convictions against the seven men. Ms Thornton admitted a joint investigation did not start until 2011, despite complaints from victims. 'Ponderous and accusatory' The force has since set up Kingfisher, a specialist unit to deal with such cases, NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said there had been a \"systematic failure\" by Oxfordshire County Council to stop the gang earlier and protect the victims, who had raised the alarm on several occasions. Oxfordshire County Council said a serious case review was being carried out by the Oxfordshire Safeguarding Children Board. A council spokesman said: \"We would like to praise the courage of the victims for giving evidence in court that has led to these sentences, and we are sorry we did not stop it sooner.\" Javed Khan, of independent charity Victim Support, said the control exerted by the men amounted to \"modern-day slavery\". Andy Dipper, from Oxford Community Against Trafficking, said the organisation would apply pressure to ensure changes to the justice and care systems. \"Victims are being stigmatised and discouraged from reporting their horrific abuse because of a system which is ponderous, accusatory and further traumatises them,\" he said. Matthew Reed, chief executive of the Children's Society, said: \"Care homes, the police, social workers and health workers all need to get better at spotting the signs of abuse. \"And they need to urgently change their attitude to vulnerable, exploited teenage girls, who are being routinely dismissed as 'troublesome' or 'promiscuous' or as having made lifestyle choices.\" 'More victim-focused' Sam Monaghan, director of children's services at children's charity Barnardo's, said: \"These men were able to abuse children for eight years. That can't be allowed to happen again. \"A fundamental shift in the collective mindset is needed at every level of the justice system.\" Policing and criminal justice minister Damian Green said the case showed more should be done to protect vulnerable children. He said: \"A new Home Office-led group will look at how to better identify those at risk and create a more victim-focused culture within the police, health and children's services. \"But our prime responsibility is, of course, stopping abuse before it starts. \"The group will be working to target the organised crime networks that perpetrate the sort of systematic abuse we have seen in Oxford.\""}

But his caution, during a CNBC interview, seemed in contrast with President Trump's optimism last week. Wall Street shares dipped at the open on worries about reaching a final deal. Last Friday, the US agreed to hold off on a planned 25%-30% tariff increase on Chinese imports that was due to come into effect on Tuesday. It followed two days of talks in Washington between Liu He, China's vice-premier, and US officials. President Donald Trump, who described the talks as a \"love fest\", said the preliminary deal would take about five weeks to complete. He added that he might sign the deal alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping at a United Nations summit in Chile in December. However, Chinese officials have been more cautious about the outcome, simply claiming there had been progress between the countries. US officials also warned last week that tariffs on a different set of Chinese goods, which are due to go into effect in December, remained an option. Still talking Mr Mnuchin told CNBC: \"I have every expectation if there's not a deal, those tariffs would go in place - but I expect we'll have a deal.\" There are still major issues to be negotiated, including industrial subsidies and cybertheft. Mr Mnuchin said more trade negotiations at various levels would take place over the coming weeks, including a phone call between himself, US Trade Representative Lighthizer, and Mr Liu. Despite the treasury secretary's caution, analysts said it still look as if talks were progressing. \"Investors are trying to wrap their head around this 'non deal',\" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth, in New York. \"If (the market) was really sceptical, it would be selling off a lot harder.

British Wool said the pandemic had led to a fall in demand for fleeces as customers stopped ordering new carpets. But the Welsh Conservatives called for a commitment to use Welsh wool in home insulation schemes. The petition, which had gained almost 28,000 signatures up to Saturday morning, called on each of the UK's national governments to use British wool products in public projects. The coronavirus pandemic had contributed to a \"disastrous\" fall in demand for the fleeces of mountain sheep, according to British Wool, a farmers' co-operative. The closure of large hotels and cruise liners - which routinely invest in new carpets - had hit producers, said John Davies, a board member. In response to campaigners, Wales' Rural Affairs Minister Lesley Griffiths said: \"I am pleased to say the Welsh Government's own facilities management team has committed to consider the more widespread use of wool in our estate in future, subject to the required compliance testing and certification.\" But the Welsh Conservatives' spokeswoman for rural affairs, Janet Finch-Saunders, said she was concerned at the government's \"passive stance\" on using Welsh wool in devolved home insulation schemes and asked for a more \"explicit commitment\". In her letter to Ms Griffiths, Ms Finch-Saunders said the situation farmers faced was \"heart-breaking\", with some receiving a \"mere 28p a fleece, an amount which is dwarfed by the cost of shearing\". Speaking to S4C's Newyddion programme in August, Wyn Evans, NFU Cymru livestock board chair, said: \"I've had a cheque this year for around £60 - that's for around 320 sheep - it's nothing.\" But wool was a \"great product and ticks all those environmental boxes,\" he said. \"It's supporting Wales and our farmers.\" Jackie Whittaker, who runs a cheese business in Rhuddlan, Denbighshire, said she wanted a \"greener business\". Mrs Whittaker said she was not aware of wool insulation until she came across the petition. She is converting her garage into a dairy and says she will now use sheep's wool as insulation. \"I think raising more awareness that it is available is needed. People might buy more,\" she said. The 52-year-old said: \"It's a crime farmers are getting paid tuppence for the wool during Covid.\" She said using wool for her building was a \"win-win\". \"It worked out cost-effective because I don't need to get any heating in the dairy, just as long as I've got the sheep's wool in the walls it will keep it warm and dry. \"It's not hugely expensive compared to other insulation. It might be another pound or two dearer, but it's a no-brainer really,\" she said. A Welsh Government spokesman said it was working to \"mitigate the impacts of Covid-19\" on farming and support long-term profitability. \"The use of wool as a building material is already acknowledged, and while we continue to encourage those in the wool sector to develop in line with these demands, there are regulations on the use of specific materials in the construction of buildings - wool can be used provided it complies with the technical requirements of such regulations,\" he added."}

It isn't a medically recognised condition but a £1.2m grant has just been awarded to fund research into it. It's hoped scientists will be able to come up with an effective treatment plan for people with diabulimia. Becky, 30, from Aberdeen, featured in the 2017 Newsbeat and BBC Three documentary Diabulimia: The World's Most Dangerous Eating Disorder. Back then she revealed that because she wasn't taking enough insulin, the bones in her feet had disintegrated into what doctors described as \"honeycomb and mush\". Becky had to use crutches because of the damage done to her feet and spent three years in and out of an eating disorder clinic. In the most serious cases, diabulimia can result in heart failure, loss of limbs and even death. A year on from the documentary, Becky tells Radio 1 Newsbeat \"things have kind of picked up\" for her. She no longer has to use crutches or see her mental health team and says she's excited for her future. \"I'm engaged to be married, my partner's moved in and we've got ourselves a little dog. \"She's my baby right now and that's helped a lot, pets do that, she gives great cuddles.\" The funding for research into diabulimia has been secured by clinician scientist Marietta Stadler, who works at King's College Hospital in London. She and her team will use the money to try and better understand diabulimia and will carry out interviews with people who have the condition. \"You can't have a bunch of doctors deciding on an intervention, you have to have the people who've lived with the condition involved,\" she says. The research is expected to take five years and the current plan is to come up with a 12 module treatment plan - a session every fortnight for six months - for patients with diabulimia. Becky says it's \"about time because diabetes is overlooked\" but she also has concerns. \"Everybody's different and we all treat our diabulimia and diabetes completely differently to each other. So I suppose that's where it could be a sticky bit. \"What can you do in 12 sessions with someone who has diabulimia? It's just scratching the surface - a fortnightly meet up - I just don't know if that's enough.\" The funding has been granted by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) - which decides to award money to research projects which it says have a \"clear benefit to patients and the public\". It told Newsbeat: \"Everything we fund should have a worthwhile and real effect in the NHS and Marietta's research was a great example of this.\" NHS England says it is continuing to join up psychological and physical health services which includes placing 3,000 new mental health therapists in GP surgeries. \"Closer working between diabetes and mental health care is just another part of the jigsaw - with more work planned as part of the long term for the NHS.\" Marietta says the research is just the \"first step\" and after five years of funding a bigger trial would be necessary before any formal treatment plan was adopted into the NHS. A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \"Like everyone, people diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes don't just have physical health needs, they have mental health needs too. \"Our ambitious 10-year Mental Health Strategy, backed by investment of £150 million over the next five years, sets out clearly how we can improve early intervention, and ensure better access to services, including specific actions to support people with eating disorders.\" For help and support on issues raised in this article visit the BBC Advice page on eating disorders.

It followed net-zero recommendations from the UK Committee on Climate Change (CCC) - which, so far, only Scotland has acted on.

All schools remain open to children with an Education and Health Care Plan (EHCP), are the children of key workers or who are eligible under guidelines set out by the Department for Education. Staff are having weekly coronavirus tests and students had two tests in their first week. A plan in place should staff and students need to work remotely. Some of the children have been out of education for up to 18 months for a number of factors. Some parents said their children had to be home-schooled as they found the mainstream school environment too difficult to cope with so waited until the Levels School opened. Others had been going through the process of securing an EHCP. This paperwork ensures the funding for a special school place. Mrs Cook said: \"At the moment staff and students are a little bit tired because obviously suddenly to go into a full day's work having to interact with individuals is exhausting. \"Also, these students are managing their own social anxiety so adrenaline is high.\" Staff have created bespoke timetables with additional rest breaks to help children regulate their energy levels and emotions.

It says there is too much focus on exams at 16 and that should be switched to 18, with more emphasis on skills people need for life and work. It calls for schools inspectors and league tables to look beyond exam results. But it says improved attainment would boost the UK's economic growth. The Confederation of British Industry, the employers' organisation, made the recommendations in a report released at the start of its annual conference. Its director general John Cridland said: \"In some cases secondary schools have become an exam factory. \"Qualifications are important, but we also need people who have self-discipline and serve customers well. As well as academic rigour, we need schools to produce rounded and grounded young people who have the skills and behaviours that businesses want.\" The business leaders say their report is for the UK as a whole, but power over education is devolved from Westminster and policies and exams taken differ. Some of their recommendations relate most closely to schools in England, where Education Secretary Michael Gove is overhauling the school system, including exams. On GCSEs, he has mainly focussed on toughening the exams, encouraging pupils to study more academic subjects, and calling for a higher percentage of pupils to score the benchmark five good GCSEs, rather than downplaying their importance. This, however, is something the Labour education team is considering as part of a wider package of reforms. 'Cult of the average' Mr Cridland told journalists the CBI was not criticising government policies - or teachers. \"Government reforms are heading in the right direction, but are not sufficient on their own and must go further and faster,\" he said. The report backs England's academy programme - where schools are encouraged to take on more independence - but is also critical. It attacks what it calls the \"cult of the average\", saying 40% of young people are underachieving while the top 10% are not being stretched enough. The report says UK schools have had 35 years of \"piecemeal reforms\" and the result has been a \"gentle upswing in performance\", judged by international benchmarks, but also a \"long tail of low achievement\". In England, from 2015, young people will be expected to stay in education or training until they are 18 and the CBI says the focus should be switching more towards exams at 18, with improved vocational A-levels. All children should study English and maths until that age, it recommends, which is in line with Labour proposals. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: \"The CBI rightly recognises the importance of English and maths, calls for greater rigour in the curriculum and in exams, welcomes the academy programme, wants a new accountability system and backs greater freedom for teachers. \"These are all part of the government's radical package of reforms that will give England's education system the thorough overhaul it needs.\" Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said: \"When business leaders say his approach to education is wrong, Michael Gove looks seriously out of touch. \"There are a number of recommendations which support Labour's policies. It confirms that Michael Gove has focussed on the wrong thing by spending two years tinkering with exams at 16, rather than offering all young people the skills and knowledge they need when they leave education at 18.\" Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Brian Lightman said the report highlighted the pressing need for a long term strategy for our education system, which will provide the stability school and college leaders require in order to embed sustainable improvements. However the CBI's claim that the UK has slipped down international league tables is misleading and statistically inaccurate as made clear by the Chair of the UK Statistics Authority and other reports.\""}

The force admitted it could have given letters about the case directly to the parents rather than via the girls. Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, left their London homes last month. After their friend - a fellow pupil at Bethnal Green Academy - had gone missing in December, the girls were among seven spoken to by police at the school as potential witnesses. The Met said the deputy head teacher had contacted the girls' families directly to inform them that their friend was missing. However, she did not tell them that the girl was believed to be in Syria - as the Met initially indicated on Saturday, before issuing a clarification. The families say that if they had known where the girls' friend was, then they could have taken steps to intervene with their own plans. Potential witnesses The 15-year-old girl, who has not been named, flew from Gatwick to Istanbul on 6 December and then travelled to the region of Syria controlled by IS. The force said all of the girls were being treated as potential witnesses who may have had information about their friend. The girls were also given letters to take to their parents in February, asking permission for counter-terrorism detectives to take handwritten statements about their friend's lifestyle and beliefs. The letters, which made it clear that the girls were not being investigated, were found hidden in their bedrooms only after the three had left home. The letters, first published by Vice News, were dated 2 February and handed to the girls three days later - 15 days before they left London. The text of the letters read: \"I understand your daughter may have known [the missing 15-year-old] as a friend. \"It is my role to understand [the missing girl] better and the reasons why she has decided to leave this country. \"I am trying to gather information which may help to find her and reunite her with her family. \"This will help the police and partner agencies to understand and prevent other vulnerable teenagers from disappearing. For these reasons I seek your permission to speak to your daughter.\" 'Vulnerable teenagers' A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said on Saturday: \"We now understand that these letters were not passed on in every case. \"With the benefit of hindsight, we acknowledge that the letters could have been delivered direct to the parents. \"All the teenagers were all being co-operative, they were all being treated as potential witnesses and there was nothing whatsoever to indicate that they themselves were planning to travel to Syria.\" There was no indication of them being vulnerable or radicalised, the force added. \"It remains a priority to try to prevent people travelling to join terrorist groups whether they be determined terrorists, radicalised individuals or vulnerable teenagers.\" The three girls are thought to have joined Islamic State (IS) in Syria, having initially taken a flight to London to Turkey. Relatives have criticised detectives for not going to them directly with what they believe was vital information about their friend or their request for statements. Kadiza's cousin, Fahmida Aziz, said: \"I think it's absolutely crazy for an authority like a school or the police not to inform the parents. \"They kept us in the dark.\" Halima Khanon, Kadiza's sister, added: \"If we had known what was going on, we would have definitely looked into this... taken precautions with my sister.\" Amira's father Abase Hussen said he believed he could have stopped her from leaving Britain for Syria. Mr Hussen said: \"The message I want to send is 'we love you, we miss you and [can't] imagine life without you'.\""}

At the city's crown court, Exley, who admitted possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, was jailed for life with a 10-and-a-half year minimum. Jones, who admitted the same offence, was jailed for 18 years. Police said the gun was fired by a masked man who appeared at the van's passenger window during the morning rush-hour in the Kingston Park area of the city in February. It shattered the glass but missed the driver, who had bought the van a few days earlier. The gunman got into a Rover driven by an accomplice and that vehicle was later found burnt out. Exley, 45, of Elswick Road, Newcastle, and Jones, 35, of no fixed address, were identified after police trawled CCTV images. However, officers were unable to say which man pulled the trigger as the moment of the attack was not recorded. When they admitted the firearms offence partway through their trial in July, prosecutors dropped an additional charge of attempted murder. Det Ch Insp Dave Cole, of Northumbria Police, said: \"These two men have admitted using that weapon believing the occupant of the van to be a rival criminal. \"What they didn't know was that the person sitting behind the wheel was an innocent member of the public. \"He is incredibly lucky not to have been hit by the bullet.\" Exley must serve a minimum of 10-and-a-half years, while Jones will be on extended licence for three years following his release.

TLP said it had taken a \"pragmatic\" decision to delay construction, as talks are ongoing over how much electricity subsidy will be paid. Work was due to get under way in 2016. TLP is also waiting for a marine licence from Natural Resources Wales and a lease from the Crown Estate. A spokesman for TLP said: \"Our Board has updated the target for the construction programme. \"The building needs to start in the spring, but first we need the remaining permissions, CfD (contract for difference) and financial close. So the pragmatic decision for spring 2016 is to move to spring 2017.\" The CfD deal is crucial - as it sets out how much the government is willing to pay towards the energy generated. 'Dithering' The Welsh government accused the UK government of \"dithering over funding\". A spokesman said: \"Earlier this week we saw the closure of Mabey Bridge in Monmouthshire due to disarray in the UK Government's energy policy and now we face the prospect of a delay to this major project because of dithering over funding from the UK Government. \"We will continue to push the UK Government to ensure this ambitious project is realised and brings significant benefits to Wales.\" The tidal lagoon on the eastern side of Swansea Bay, between the docks and the new university campus, would use the flow and ebb of the tide to generate energy, which would then be converted into electricity. But before the lagoon becomes a reality, there are two main challenges that need to be met: Thousands of construction and manufacturing jobs could be created, especially if five much bigger lagoons are built in the Severn estuary and off the north Wales coast. It could also boost to the UK's standing as a generator of clean, green energy. Analysis BBC Wales environment correspondent, Iolo ap Dafydd Three elements are needed before Swansea's lagoon can be built - a marine licence by NRW, a lease agreement with Crown Estate and most importantly a subsidy for the power generated of £168 per megawatt hour (pmh) of energy generated. So far DECC officials and ministers are taking their time. Why? Well because this governmental support that's been requested is the most expensive yet. Hinkley C's proposed nuclear plant will - if built - receive between £89-£92.50/pmh. Also, the support requested is over a 35 year period. This support is public money, at a time when austerity cuts have come thick and fast in many public services. According to DECC there's no specific timetable for the financial negotiations, and it is pursuing a diligence process to assess TLP's plans. The weather is also of critical importance - any construction out to sea has to start during the spring to allow enough work to be done at a time of expected good weather. It's thought to be too much of a risk to start work mid-summer or during the autumn. What excites the UK government is that the Swansea lagoon if seen to be successful, could lead to a string of other lagoons - much larger ones near Cardiff, Newport and Colwyn Bay. They could be generating power for up to a 120 years through the regularity of the tides. Another pressing issue is that a quarter of Britain's power plants could be decommissioned in the next 10 years, and the fear is there won't be enough replacement power in the national electricity grid. That could lead to sporadic blackouts. How would the lagoon work? Source: Tidal Lagoon Power Ltd"}

He was captured in 2002 at the age of 15 and spent a decade in the US prison. In 2010, Canada's Supreme Court ruled that he was interrogated under \"oppressive circumstances.\" He will reportedly be paid $8m (£6m). Khadr's lawyers met with justice department attorneys last month to reach the deal, the Toronto Star newspaper reported, quoting unnamed sources. The announcement of an official apology and compensation would be made next week, the reports added. When asked about the case, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, would not confirm any details. Khadr, who was the youngest prisoner ever detained at the naval base in Cuba, became a cause celebre for Guantanamo Bay opponents and his case received international attention. He was convicted of five crimes, including throwing a grenade that killed Army Sgt Christopher Speer in 2002. He was shot and captured during the fire fight in Afghanistan. Khadr said his confessions to US officials were made under duress He was repatriated in 2012 after agreeing to a plea deal to leave Guantanamo and serve the majority of his eight-year sentence in Canada. In 2010, Canada's Supreme Court concluded that Canada's conduct in connection with Khadr's case \"did not conform to the principles of fundamental justice\" and violated his constitutional rights. The court noted he was subjected to sleep deprivation to make him \"less resistant to interrogation\". In 2015, a judge released Khadr on bail despite a last minute appeal by the then federal Conservative government to keep him in jail. He said then that he would prove to Canadians that he was a \"good person\". Khadr is the son of an alleged close associate of Osama Bin Laden and was drawn into militant circles when he was young. He spent his youth in Canada and Pakistan, where his father had interests. His case has long polarised public opinion in Canada. His defenders describe him as a child soldier while others argue he was a radicalised fighter at the time of his capture."}

The closure is the latest move in a bigger global restructuring. It follows warnings of thousands of job cuts in the UK and mainland Europe. Lyle Watters, president of Ford of South America, said Ford remained \"committed\" to the South American region. He said the firm was focused on improving its product offerings and implementing \"a leaner, more agile business model\". About 2,800 job cuts are expected, according to labour organisations - a blow in a country where the unemployment rate is already above 10%. \"We know this action will have a major impact on our employees in São Bernardo and we will be working closely with all our stakeholders on the next steps,\" Mr Watters said. The decision to close the factory and exit the heavy truck business comes as Ford grapples with a sharp decline in profits driven by its international operations. In South America, revenue fell 9% last year and the firm lost market share in most countries. In addition to the Sao Bernardo closure, Ford recently stopped making its Focus car in Argentina. The company said it had also slashed salaried and administrative costs in the region by more than 20% in the past few months. 'Major impact' The Sao Bernardo do Campo facility currently produces Ford Cargo trucks, certain F Series trucks and the Fiesta car. Sales of those models will end after its inventories are sold, Ford said. The closure is expected to cost Ford about $460m, with much of those costs due to separation and termination payments for employees, dealers and suppliers. The Sao Bernardo do Campo assembly plant is one of two Ford factories in Brazil and has been operational since 1967. It is located near Sao Paulo, in an area with a rich history of car-making and unionised labour, which helped to launch the career of former Brazilian president Luis Inácio Lula da Silva."}

Anyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election. You can register to vote online. Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie warned of \"a mountain of delays\" for mental health treatment and called for action on mental health to be the first priority of the pandemic recovery. Mr Rennie said official figures showed 1,892 children and 5,452 adults were waiting more than a year for mental health treatment. He said: \"For too long, vulnerable people have been subjected to harrowing long waits for mental health treatment. It is impossible to imagine just how hard it must be. Despite the warnings, the pandemic has left a mountain of delays. \"As Scotland begins to reopen, we desperately need to put the recovery first and invest in mental health services. \"Our NHS staff do an incredible job. People deserve a government that gets behind them and puts mental health at the top of the agenda.\" Reducing road traffic The Scottish Greens said the party's Rail For All plan to upgrade and decarbonise Scotland's railways would create nearly 17,000 jobs. Co-leader Patrick Harvie said the plans were \"ambitious and transformative, but the climate emergency demands no less\". They include improving inter-city services and upgrading regional links, while opening new stations across the country. More freight would also be shifted on to rail to reduce road traffic, Mr Harvie said. He added: \"Successive governments have favoured roads over railways, but the Scottish Greens recognise the urgent need to reverse that, which is why we are asking people to vote like our future depends on it in May.\" Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish government's response throughout the pandemic may have helped boost support for independence. The first minister said the first act of a re-elected SNP government would be \"to continue to take the country as safely as we can through Covid\". She added: \"If I could change things so we had never had Covid and that meant support for independence wasn't quite as high as it was, I would trade any day. \"But people have, at a time of crisis, looked to their own government here in Scotland to lead. \"They won't have agreed with every decision we have taken at times, but at a time of crisis I think what we have seen is that natural inclination of people to look to their own democratically-elected government.\" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said his party would put new work opportunities for young Scots at the heart of its jobs recovery plan.

It means long A&E waits are at their highest level since 2004. The group said it was a sign hospitals were struggling, but ministers said the waits were within acceptable levels. The health service is allowed to let up to 5% of the 21m patients who visit A&E units each year wait longer than four hours. This is built into the system to give doctors the freedom to prioritise the sickest patients. So the proportion of patients waiting for over four hours is still within the target, which measures the length of time from arrival at A&E to discharge or admission to hospital. What is more, that leeway has been increased from 2% in the past year. 'Steep rise' The King's Fund, which used government figures for its analysis, accepted the rise seen over the last 12 months could be partly linked to prioritising of the most unwell. But it also said it was indicative of the pressures in the health service - funding is being squeezed at a time when A&E units are having to treat more patients. Professor John Appleby, the chief economist of the King's Fund, said the \"steep rise\" should be a concern for the government. Mike Clancy, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said: \"The A&E waiting times are a reflection of how the whole system is working. \"The pressure on beds is increasing and this in part may account for the increasing reporting of overcrowding of departments.\" And shadow health secretary Andy Burnham added: \"This report is highly embarrassing for a prime minister who said A&E waits would be one of the tests of his NHS re-organisation. \"On Cameron's watch, the NHS is heading back to the bad old days of chaos in A&E and patients left on trolleys.\" But Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said the King's Fund was \"wrong\" to suggest it was a growing problem as the government had given hosptials greater flexibility over how quickly they treat patients."}

Overall, more than 70% of births took place outside regular working hours. The analysis of five million births between 2005 and 2014 was carried out by University College London. The researchers said there could be implications for staffing of midwives and doctors, with only 28% of births taking place between 09:00 and 17:00 on weekdays. Birth trends Since the 1950s, patterns of birth have changed because of rising rates of intervention, such as C-sections and inductions. Prof Alison Macfarlane, research author from City, University of London, said that \"current trends in obstetric intervention at birth may work in opposite directions\". With rates of induction rising, she said induced births were more likely to occur at night, while rates of pre-planned caesareans - which are also going up - are likely to be scheduled for morning hours. She added that more home births could \"lower rates of obstetric intervention and affect these trends and impact on the overall timing of birth\". Dr Peter Martin, lecturer in applied statistics at University College London, who was also part of the research team, said there could be an evolutionary reason for spontaneous births being concentrated at night. \"Our ancestors lived in groups that were active and dispersed during the day and came together to rest at night. \"So a night-time labour and birth probably afforded the mother and newborn baby some protection.\" However, this doesn't explain why spontaneous birth numbers were 7% lower on Christmas Day and Boxing Day. More than just birth Sean O'Sullivan, from the Royal College of Midwives, said the research would help maternity services to organise their staffing rotas but individual services would also need to look at the patterns of birth in their local areas. He said the work of midwives encompassed more than just birth, including antenatal and postnatal care, infant feeding and maternal mental health. \"Any planning of services must consider also these aspects of care,\" he said. Elizabeth Duff, senior policy adviser from the parent's charity NCT, said: \"This study tells us parents aren't bothered about the timing of the birth as long as it results in healthy mums and babies. \"So it's worrying that induction appears to be timed so that the babies are most frequently born around midnight, when senior staff are less widely available to assist if complications arise.\""}

But the Barlows are far from alone in suffering such a tragic experience. Stillbirth rates in the UK are higher than almost every other high-income country. There are over 4,000 stillbirths every year in the UK - the equivalent of 11 per day. That equates to 3.5 per 1,000 births which, according to a Lancet study last year, means only France and Austria had worst rates among richer nations. Lack of research Dr Beckie Lang, from baby charity Tommy's says: \"Losing a baby at any stage is devastating, and every parent's worst nightmare. The most frequently asked question after the loss of a baby is 'Why did my baby die?\" \"As the cause of a baby's death is often a mystery, no explanation can be given to the bereaved parents, which makes the grieving process so much harder. \"If we don't understand what causes stillbirth, we cannot get to the root of the problem - and this is why medical research in to finding the causes and preventions of stillbirth remains so vital.\" However, despite years of research there is still much which remains unknown about the issue. While problems with the placenta, which can affect the growth of the foetus, infections and congential abnormalities are all known causes of stillbirths, for a third of cases there is no known reason. There are also risk factors which can increase the risk of stillbirth. Smoking and drinking during pregnancy can increase susceptibility, as can being overweight or obese, or having children later in life. Previous caesarean sections can also increase risk, as can multiple births. No money Janet Scott, head of research at Sands, a stillbirth charity, says: \"There is still a lack of knowledge on why deaths are happening. \"For those that are unexplained or occurring in low risk pregnancies it is probably down to placenta cord development - but we need to understand this better and develop tools to spot babies in trouble. \"There are many researchers with ideas for different approaches, but there is a dearth of funding.\" This is also echoed by Prof Andy Shennan, a consultant obstetrician for Tommy's. \"Personally I think the amount of money going into preventions strategies for stillbirth, given the devastation it causes, is exceptionally low. \"Especially when compared to public health research in areas like cancer and cardiovascular disease, which for obvious reasons get a lot of support and are talked about.\" Taboo subject Stillbirth is not something that gets talked about. Prof Shennan says: \"The subject is terribly taboo - I think because of the emotions from expectation at a very wonderful time to devastation, from one extreme to the other. \"I also think mothers incorrectly feel they have failed, or done something wrong. In my hospital we have dedicated rooms downstairs for dead babies which are almost permanently in use. It is a real issue - one people are surprised to hear about - it therefore gets less support and mothers aren't aware of the risks.\""}
